to see if she filled it correctlyshe acted a if she couldnt be bothered with that so i asked her againshe begrudgingly checked to she did in fact miss something on the ticketso after minute i finally had my breakfast biscuit platteras i left an woman approached and identified herself a the manager she wa dressed a if she had just awoken in an old tshirt and sweat pantsshe said she had heard what

fail on the service end of thing the order taker tend to be rude no smile and a lot of sigh and lip smacking when you talk to them so why go back you ask this store benefit from being the only place to eat in this area the next stop is at least minute away on the other side of town also i strongly believe in nd chance and know that not every business can satisfy everyone of the time i have given

mcdonalds this is primarily because they are so slow my gosh what exactly is the hold up it fast food people also this morning i guess the worker thought his mic wa off but it wasnt i now know that he is trying to get a many hour a possible because he need money bad spread the word anyway this location is on a little access road and you have to go back the way you came because there is no exit from it at the other end it would have helped if there wa one so in the end i think ill avoid this location and find another this should be easy a there is no shortage of mickey d in this piece', 'one star and im beng kind i blame management last day of free coffee so we decide to stop and order breakfast and coffee thru drivethru she charged u for coffee and when asked why she said she needed to confirm there were two of u in the car now she ha to clear the order and that took retraining ask next time at tthe speakeroh it get betterwe get to next window where einstein is waiting pours the

a quick bite to eat before our drive back home we pull up to the drive thru but there are a lot of car waiting to order we were guessing there must be a lot demand for mcdonalds at this late hour so we wait about minute for our turn to order we order the special they were having at that time pc chicken nugget for and asked for a cup of water because we didnt want to drink any soda at that late hour they take our order but tell u they dont serve cup of water there so we are a little annoyed but ok we shrug it off and wait our turn to pay and receive our order however we wait for almost another min to finally pay at the first window then another more min to finally receive our food by far the worst mcdonalds in the world unfriendly and slow', 'this mcdonalds ha gotten much better usually my order would be wrong every single time so i would not leave that window until i checked every single item i only hit up fast food once a month or so and it need to be worth it also the fry used to be cold and the cheese on the burger wa never melted everything wa just lukewarm now my order ha been right a few time in a row and my food hot also i love dining room usually you wouldnt find me actually inside a fast food joint but this place ha nice flooring stacked stone lot of large window and a flat screen tv usually on hln sometimes it nice to sneak away for a quick weekend breakfast you know a little budget and time friendly mommy and me date', 'let start here only reason i came into mcdonalds waste time till girlfriend flight arrives and for my duaghters i dont eat fast food

stabding right in front of him im glad i will never have to return here i live way in sandy spring i can see the difference between service and the staff the building it self is brand new change your staff this is blackmac not mcdonalds im black myself but telling the truth', 'other business throughout metro atlanta opened their door to stranded motorist during the jan snow storm this mcdonalds on camp creek parkway told a group of senior citizen who were on the way home from an outing that they had to leave their restaurant all they cared about wa the dollar after they got that they were done with them too bad they couldnt have made it down the street to wendys or chic fil a and other restaurant', 'the drive thru make them lost a star since my last reviewthis is one of those two lane drive thrus and i know that the function of that is so that the order are not messed up when you get to the window but almost everytime the cashier end up asking me what did i order i inquired about that before and wa told that when someone drive off that mess up the orderwell i guess there no controlling drive off and at least i know my order ha been confirmed so it should be right by the time i get to the second windowthis mcdonalds also ha a late night drive thru thur sat it use to be a hour on those day but i dont think it is any longer one of my biggest pet peeve is that the drive thru staff ha no smile in their voice when you are ordering food from the luxury of your vehicle you want to think that the person in charge of taking your order is in good spirit but not at this location', 'believe it or not this used to be q really good mcdonalds the drive throuh is so slow it is frustrating but the service is always friendly food is normally luke warm my niece like the toy from mcdonalds i wonder if i pull up to the window and say let me just get the toy woulf service be faster', 'a the previous yelpers have already stated this place is pretty slow the food is usually cold

reheated everything is out napkin iced tea', 'slowslowslow dont go here if you have a flight to catchor a life to live if youre hungry wait until you get to the airport this particular mcdonalds is just not worth your time', 'on your way to the airport or just cruising down camp creek pkwy are you absolutely in love with mcdonalds sweet tea well then dont ever go through this drive thru hand down this is the slowest mcdonalds drive thru ive experienced in atlanta considering this location is close to the airport it would be great if they could simply improve the quality of service a a lover of sweet tea i wa completely turned off by this location when i overheard the drive thru operator joking about how sweet it wa a few year ago she told a few of her associate that it wa like syrup and liquid diabetes by the time i took my first and only sip i wa on i headed to perimeter mall and it tasted like cold syrup thank goodness for the mcdonalds near perimeter mall because they refilled my drink so the moral to the story is if youre on camp creek pkwy near the airport bypass mcdonalds and head for chickfila eatmorechicken', 'this is the worst mcdonalds i have ever seen the service wa terrible and the employee were either lazy or incompetent i will never return to this establishment', 'i had the mccafe mocha and must say that it wa better than drinking sand and salt water thats about ittoo sweet and i couldnt even taste the coffee over the other weird flavor going on in this drinkstick with the starbucks mocha folk trust me on this one', 'ghetto went in yesterday just to get a soda and could not even park in handicap parking spot because their delivery truck wa blocking all space finally made it inside and it wa about customer to one cashier the shift manager made the comment that the car that wa waiting needed to be pulled up because they are holding up her line now how is that when they are waiting on their orderhell i wa thinking you are holding up the customer and the others waiting anyway finally placed order and wa told which i paid exact price here is where it sadthe cashier did not ring up the soda so therefore i did not get a receipt i know that she planned to pocket the money which is sad and bad because eventually that cost will get passed off to customer through price increase i will not return here because i dont like to feel like i am in someone hood and i hate a thief maybe i will call to tell them but then again they probably dont care or maybe even steal themselves plus i do not eat fast food anyway so no need to waste precious minute', 'i visited mcdonalds on dec at i bought cheese burger large fry and order of pie they charged me for fry so i went back into store and told the cashier she denied i said i ordered fry then manager came over and said whats the problem i told him and he said looked into the bag grabbed the xtra fry and lterally threw them into the waste bucket by the drive tru from the cashier then reached into cash register and gave me change for the fry then i said thank you and he said ok bos and i left i then called mcdonalds people via the nimber on the website after i ate i told then i wa going to wait to yelp after i heard from mcdonalds still no call or email a a side note tom n the otther yelper is right they are very rude there and seem bothered to help you and not at all nice to the kid the play room is sticky and the video game in ther always cause an altercation with kid and parent the only reason i gave star wa because the fry were hot and the sweet potatoe fry were good and warm', 'i usually hit the drive thru once or twice a week for breakfast a lot of time the forget to include the hash brown if i order a meal if i order hot cake they usually forget either butter or utinsils prompting me to have to go inside the food is also very inconsistent', 'what a jokedont do take out a you will not get anything that you ordered we prefers and paid for item only to

mcdonalds i have ever visited i have been to hundred of different mcdonalds in numerous state a well a foreign country i went to this location on for breakfast the first thing i noticed wa that the floor wa sticky a previous reviewer made a similar comment about the play area when i noticed this i said to myself this isnt right then when i looked for a place to sit i spotted all the debris in the seat crevice and the floor there were also fly in the dining area which i had to repeatedly brush off my food a for the food it seemed ok except this wa the first time ever that i wa given cold syrup for my hotcake at a mcdonalds', 'this is one rude mcdonalds the food take longer to prepare than any other macdonalds i have ever been to the people working there always seem annoyed like you are bothering them just by being there i avoid this mc d whenever i can', 'the manager at this mcdonalds are awesome but some of the worker are lazy overall an average mcdonalds after visiting it and some other once i realized that this one is really average the only thing good about this one is that the management is awesome and it across the street from my house so i can sit around and study till midnight and no one bother me', 'it had been a while since i had stopped at this particular one they have done a total remodel and it look fairly fresh stopped by about pm and went through drive

about minute later im still waiting so i go to check what is going on and end up waiting another minute it appeared i wasnt the only one that had a long wait in drive thru a well mcwrap i wa disappointed looked like a wrap that had grilled chicken sprinkle with some mixed green then had sweet and sour sauce dumped in it', 'disorganized didnt even get to order employee were hanging out with friend out front', 'this ha got to be one of the busiest mcdonalds in the metro area if not the southeast and they are fairly efficient despite being so busy all the timeyou can come by just about any time of the day and find the line of car for the drivethru wrapped around the buildingits generally more efficient to go into the building and place your order than wait in the line of car spewing smog and since the building is open hour now that should make it easy to get your mcfixgood job clairmont mcdonalds', 'this mcdonalds is horrible they are also down the street from my house

forced to buy at mcdonalds mostly my visit were for coffee or ice cream sundae however last night for the first time i ordered food grilled chicken salad i returned it the meat smelled badly this did not surprise me and only enforced my resolve to avoid chain food restaurantswhat did surprise me and absolutely shocked me wa the customer service offered by employee how in the world can you be an employee here and not for one minute or even a second acknowledge the obvious fact that you work inside a hospital then consider what that mean for each and every person that approach your counter to order how you do not see them in fact that you easily dismiss them is beyond my comprehension to understand how you lost your sense of humanity in all honestly should cause you to pause and contemplate this are you not aware that you are reflecting how you measure within you your own sense of dignitywithin my and familyfriends of patient at northside hospital for the past week each and every time ithey had to place an order i they waswere subjected to mcdonalds toxic business model in food which now ha transferred we learned into their employee not once wa i thanked for giving my order not once wa i thanked when delivered my order yet at every visit i waited and witnessed employee behavior that were readily displayed and relayed in body language effort toward actual work and obvious attitude not only toward me but guest in front of me god forbid i happened to have question in reference to the menu employee response blank stare shrug looking behind them at menu only to turn back around with a blank stare andor shrug again god forbid on separate occasion i happened to ask for a spoonnapkinstraw last night i happened to ask for my drink please after receiving my salad

continue to allow a daily dose of deliberate and diligent unhealthy negative and put upon attitude from employee to be delivered to family friend and employee that are there only because they care and are there for your patient how this doe not cause you to react and act is beyond mein my world with so many option available this place would be gone like today certainly not any longer than

ferry and new northside on the north end of the perimeter i have always avoided this location due to the fact that im not really a fan of mcdonalds in general but the other morning on my way to work i wa craving some breakfast and only had time to pull into a drivethru and grab a quick bite to go since mcdonalds is the only place with a drivethru on my way to work i stopped by here to grab their special bacon egg cheese biscuit for the food wa ok just tasted like you would expect mcdonalds food to taste the service wa pretty good at the drivethru they were friendly enough but what really get me is how lazy ha america become that the drivethru welcome and what would you like to order ha to be automated at mcdonalds', 'itll make ya fat', 'on my way to curry honda for my scheduled maintenance appointment i went to the drivethru of this mcdonalds since it wa so conveniently located almost adjacent to the honda dealership it wa around pm on a saturday afternoon and there were probably only two car in front of me so i thought id be in and out of there quickly what i thought would be a quick drivethru took over ten minute im not sure what the hold up wa but perhaps one or both of the car in front of me got a large order all i ordered wa a spicy mcchicken sandwich small fry and a cup of ice wateragain curry honda is located super close to the mcdonalds so the food should have still been hot or at least warm when i got there however when i sat down to eat my food in the waiting room i noticed the sandwich and fry were barely warm and the ice in my water wa almost completely melted i guess the food had been cooked and sitting out for a while and they must keep cup of ice water ready to hand out to customer boo it wa my first time trying the spicy mcchicken sandwich and i thought it wa decent it ha a very slight kick of spice and is at least a little more interesting than the plain ol mcchicken sandwichoverall this mcdonalds get star for being ok yes service could have been quicker and the food should have been served hotter but this is a mcdonalds and at least the employee were friendly i may return to this mcdonalds if im on my way to curry honda and didnt have time to grab food elsewhere but it wouldnt be my top choice for fast food in the areareview of', 'just sat at drive thru several minute no one is answering i can see

the price of mistake happen so i kept my receipt and went back exactly a week later within the hour since i wa making the same trip i went inside out of respect to show my face that i wasnt trying to scam them and the manager wa working the register i told him what happened and that id like the specialty coffee i originally ordered he pointed that it had been a week since the original purchase and that he needed proof i wasnt lying about my incorrect order mind you at am people were all waiting around for their order which show slow and poor service i didnt argue and i walked away leaving my receipt on the counter i wa simply asking for a coffee not even an entire meal i dont post about these sort of thing but this time wa different the manager could have easily offered a variety of resolution but all he said wa no im sorry well im sorry but ive never been so dissatisfied with customer service and let alone management of a restaurant please stay away from this location for the

wa full of lint stay away from this location', 'customer service is well below par here i placed my order through the intercom and wa told that id have to pay in separate transaction if i were to use more than coupon i expected that and wa fine with it up until i got to the window in which one of the girl working the cashier had a problem with me using the coupon and i quote mentioned i dont give a d and a f what she want i never make it a goal to be difficult to other people and i find it very rude let alone unnecessary that i received this treatment it is part of your job duty to simply put in a customer order if you dont like your job you have no business being there and there are plenty of job seeker out there who would be more deserving of your position to top it off after i left the restaurant i opened my bag to find out that i didnt receive everything i ordered and paid for', 'food is good but whats with all the fly and nats always in the air ive mentoned this to management

about the dining area since i always use the drive thru customer service ha been great a they always take care of mewhen i go to mcdonalds i get either the big mac meal or the quarter pounder meal big

the worst decision the dual lane drive through is anything but fast one car in front of me but somehow the other lane wa the only one moving some odd minute later we finally ordered one of the car in front of me obviously knew somebody in the place and just kept talking at the window it wouldnt have been a big deal if it hadnt continued for so long after minute of sitting in this line fighting the urge to just drive off and watching the multiple level of poor service we finally got our snack and the freaking fry were cold i should have taken minute to read the review before i went here and it would have stopped me from ever going you would think after all that time at least the food would be hot ha just do yourself a favor and find another mcds to visit truly a disappointing stop', 'this

is closed need nightafterdrinking breakfast yes please on all count i havent found this mcdonalds to be particularly slow it is a bit sketch by decatur standard although it north decatur and not decatur proper often at night there are folk who look homeless here though only one one occasion ha anything particularly creepydisturbing happened regarding said demographic of patron otherwise it lot of emory student and hospital worker and high school student from druid hill high i like that the worker seem to have a good camaraderie with each other i also like that folk remember my standard order and can associate my voice with my order when i go through the drive thru', 'this is the worst mcdonalds i have ever visited we sat at the drivethru window forever watching the employee goof off the fish sandwich wa edible in a square processed fish round bun too much tartar sauce sort of way the french fry were horrible they were not edible they were stale and greasyjust because someone is holding a broom doe not mean that they are sweeping the broom is a prop to make people think they are working while they are socializing with coworkers they will look at you occasionally while they continue to goof off the employee seem to go out of their way to prove that you arent worth their time this mcdonalds really suck', 'the staff is really nice but kind of slow at this location i asked what type of sauce they had and the cashier looked at me like she saw a ghost i am not that pale all i wanted well not really were some chicken nugget to feed to my starving kid if i had passed somewhere else with a drive thru i would have gone there but this wa my only option when i pulled up to get my count i wa handed a small bag with a small fry i asked the guy why he wa handing it to me

the dirtiest mcdonald ive seen in a long time staff is unfriendly and obviously so bored with their job definitely not even place for a quick meal', 'the service at this mcdonalds is so bad it almost comical case in point there wa about a two week stretch where i would go to mcdonalds every morning before work to get an iced vanilla latte every day i kid you not they got my order wrong and made me a hot latte instead this would not be a problem but they questioned me every time if i wa sure that wa what i ordered yes it even showed it on your fancy digital menu then they would ask me to pull up and wait minute for my order to be corrected my bf and i went inside once to order and they got his order wrong the woman just stood there and looked at u when we told her and my bf wa like but i guess i can eat this later when we went up and asked for sauce she gave u the biggest eyeroll upon seeing u and acted like it wa physically painful for her to serve u these are only a couple of example of the horrible service we have had but i guess thats typical for a mcdonalds attached to a gas station', 'im hooked on the mcdonalds oatmealwhen i want to grab some breakfast thats yummy healthy and easy to eat while im driving i head here im always met with friendly service at the drivethrough they move pretty quickly and always get my order correct no matter how busy they are',

store and spoke to manager starla who told me refund can take up to two day to go through it tuesday oct th my payment went through yesterday for two meal purchased oct rd one of which i didnt eat or take with me not happy starla tried to make the excuse that yesterday oct th wa a holiday i said what holiday she say columbus day i never had respect for that man but do recognize his holiday is on the th for my bank so i informed starla that yesterday wa not a bank holiday she wouldnt call the gm this evening stating the gm general manager would be there tomorrow between to im working then too

the drivethru and got a simple order a mcchicken sandwich and small fry i drove to the studio movie grill parking lot to eat before a movie and noticed that my fry were cold ughhhhh cold mcdonalds fry are the worst lamethe employee seem to be pretty friendly and the restaurant look decent inside unfortunately they lack power outlet i saw one but maybe there a one or two more scattered throughout the restaurant this make it inconvenient for people who like to stop by mcdonalds to use their laptop which i do quite oftenoverall this mcdonalds deserves about star because it right in between meh and aok i know some may say it just a mcdonalds but hey ive been to numerous other location where their food is pretty consistent dont serve cold fry and there are numerous power outlet for customer use ill probably be back just because it right next to studio movie grill but im hoping theyll start improving the quality of their fast food at least to the mcdonalds standardreview of', 'ive only been to this mcdonalds twice and both time were bad experience not only doe the place smell of dirty rag and cleaner solution but the service is bad a well i guess the convenient location is what keep

mcdonalds however sometimes nothing hit the spot like their fry and a diet coke what push this location over the edge of some others is the staff theyre always super nice whether it am or pm they dont make you repeat your order time and they get it right theyre also generous with the condiment when you ask for them and even when you dont unlike some fast food place that stop serving milkshake after a certain hour because theyve already cleaned the machine theyll make you a milkshake up until they close service is a huge thing for me so the fact that theyre always smiling and ready to help me get my fat fix is what make me partial to this particular location it can be a bit of a pain to get into and out of a it right on holcomb bridge rd but thats a minor annoyance', 'only the fact that it a mcdonalds is what earns it a star the staff at this location can vary from customer service focused to blatant disregard about anything other than accepting your food order and taking your payment my

around to the window the person that wa to take my money and give me my food wa way more interested in an argument that wa going on outside in the parking lot between two young lady and the two young

light then travel back through the parking lot to your get your mcgrub without inconveniencing all the people in car trying to get to work or homethis advice make much more sense than the numbskulls

one of those s bhorror movie where one of the worker get infected with the zombievampirewerewolf virus and then come to work the next day and spread it to all his coworkers thats the only logical explanation because every worker here ha transformed into mcdumbassesi want to remind you that this is summerlin so that mean that everyone run stop sign no one yield for pedestrian and everyone argues over the stupidest most insignificant thing watch out when you are entering this drivethru because there is a huge chance that some douchebag in a bmw will run the stop sign in order to cut in

drunk orson well when i pulled up to the first window to pay the window slowly slid open to reveal the face of a morbid looking kid with gigantic dilated eye and one of those horror movie smile immediately he let out this high pitched reeehhhhhhhhhhhhhh noise at me at that particular moment due to the fear of manrape i thought about driving over the planter and escaping but he looked so weird that i came to the conclusion that he might have some kind of paranormal super power and would catch me no matter how fast i drove so i just sat there and awaited my fate after about second he told me how much my coffee cost in a disturbingly soft tone voice and thankfully he didnt serve me mcrape when i drove up to the pickup window i wa greeted by an anorexic looking latino kid who didnt even give me eye contact and while holding the coffee he stick his arm out the window and just drop it before i even have the chance to reach out to grab it it wa a miracle that i caught the thing in mid air i wa glad to get the mcfck out of there', 'awful service and extremely slow go elsewhere', 'i love mcdonalds grew up on it and still take my boy there regularly and i have to say this the location off of the circle in summerlin really ha some hard time keeping up the place always seems to be a bit dirty both in the lobby and behind the counter i dread getting a quick bite with the boy when we are in a hurry a they are never fast in the drive thru but the food is always just a good at any other mcdonalds so they do have that going for them it is literally though one of the slowest mickey d i have ever been to and this is not just one experience i go very regularly because a i said i love it and this one is the closest to me so for convenience but sometimes i wonder if it would

sandwich and i heard via the talk thread that mcdonalds in la vega started serving them the other day so i took my son here to give this legendary sandwich a trywe ordered two mcrib meal sandwich fry

courseand the spicy mcchicken sandwich wa decent not bad for overall it wa a complete waste of calorie im not dinging mcdonalds for my stupid curiosity so they get star the mcdonalds experience wa aok did i find value in my meal not todaymy fault thoughwill i return id come back again to order something i enjoy', 'pretty good service for fast food', 'the drive through line is terrible they are painfully slow', 'this ha to be the worst mcdonalds within a mile radius the staff are young rude untrained kid from the local middle school and the drivethrough is really painfull this location should be closed down or sold to someone who know how to run a mcdonalds theyre always out of something there never a cashier in the first drive through window where your supposed to pay so people sit in their car and wait for a cashier to magically appear to take their moneynot happening so then you decide to walk in to order thinking youll get your order faster and not missing somethingwrong a you stand there and wait for them to make and bag your order your watching the car that would have been behind you in the drivethrough leave wtf next time im getting mexican food', 'year of pathetic service disgusting food and dangerous mistake why do i keep going backhaving nothing to do with mcdonalds food in general and more to do with the ability of this specific location to produce it with out killing anybody i have been going to this particular store for year it is right around the corner from where i used to live and is on the way from where i live to pretty much everything i use gas station costco movie theater market etc it is the only convenient location and for a while mcdonalds wa the only place that had drink so those are my lame excuse for repeatedly torturing myself with this horrible place service i used to be a manager with another fast food chain i know what service should be i also know what it usually is it doesnt have to be star but the rude attitude ridiculously slow service and inability to get a single order right is really a bit too much when i say slow service i am talking minute is average drive thru time for a dollar menu burger and a soda correct order yes my order can occasionally be complicated no castup add big mac sauce but when i thought they could do no worse they messed up an order for large drink diet coke a lemonade and an unsweet iced tea all with extra ice we received a regular coke a lemonade a dr pepper and a sweet iced tea drink had no ice at all and the other had a few piece floating around we have never received a correct order from this store ever i could go on and on about it but i will stick with this sad example and move ondangerousdisgustingincorrectly made something a little different then an order where they put the wrong thing in the bag or mess up a custom is when they just make it incorrectly or dangerously some of the example of this include pie that expired an hour before i received them an egg that wa completely raw in the middle and tonight lovely mess up tonight i ordered the angus mushroom and swiss according to the website this should include full slice of swiss cheese and a decent amount of mushroom i had about a teaspoon of mushroom no sauce and a slice of cheese that is right they left off a slice and a half of cheese in addition it wa a regular and relatively old quarter pound patty not the big ole angus patty they should have used i have called the number on the receipt multiple time that take me to the district office they consistently send out a free sandwich or drink coupon to apologize they tell me how sorry they are and suggest i try one of their other location a this is the only one they receive complaint from from what i wa told they are revamping this store but i have been told that for well over a year and it seems to have been unvamped and going down hill which i didnt think wa even possible i keep vowing this will be my last visit but then find myself sitting in the drive thru line yet again wondering if i will ever receive my food i highly do not recommend this location hopefully you wont be lured in by whatever the heck keep luring me sarah this wa written by paul wife because i am usually the one dealing with them i guess he got smarter', 'my drive through experience wa a pleasant one the worker seemed very friendly and i received quick service whenever i go to drive thrus im not usually asked how my day is going unless im at starbucks i didnt feel like i wa rushed and the most important thing is they didnt forget

place a small order not mcmuffins a the morning before for me the posse who got called into work on a sunday this time i opt to go thru the drivethru coz nobody in line wow it looking good or so i thought paid for my simple order at the st window then waited more minute behind the only car at the pickup window here we go am i gonna be later for work again with only car in front of me wtf car were honking ferociously behind me now im blocked in low and behold when i move up i recognize the guy handing me my food a one of the mcdonalds worker who stepped over my pile of food in slowmotion matrix effect yesterday morning ughhh guess theyre probably hiring at this fast food establishment and will take any dreggs off the street who either ha a pulse or a trust fund so whats the hurry gave them a nd chance learned my lesson wont ever go back a an aside took the time to email mcdonalds and got the proverbial party line response ie we pride ourselves on blah blah blah i normally believe in redemption but not from this place', 'parking not very welcoming to large rv and dont park next door at the convenience station they charge to park staff seemed confused on how to handle special

had the choice of getting a sweet tea or a coke product with my breakfast sandwich and hash brown now that i have experienced sweet tea with a sausage egg biscuit i can say with all certainty that these two item should not be served togetherthis particular mcdonalds doe not exude any of mcdonalds core philosophy such a variety or efficiency it seems poorly stocked poorly operated and under maintained the bathroom are filthy and i would suggest buying a cheap pair of sock for your child because their sock will be coated in dirt after minute of playing the only thing that wa good about my visit wa my sausage egg biscuit sandwich the hash brown tasted a though it had fried in old rancid oil the sweet tea while good by itself shouldnt be of option available during the morning since

beer and poor from expensive gambling it wa am and although our appetite were ginormous our option were limited we happened upon this mcdonalds where they were offering double cheeseburger for i ordered three my companion followed suit we sat down among the other customer three older men sparsely seated and desperate to stay awake lest they be thrown out in the street amongst the crumpled pornographic business card one man chewed with his eye closed another bobbed his head up and down either he wa falling in and out of sleep or agreeing with everything the last man wa not so far gone

something to her no apology she would not give me the small coffee i wanted instead of the large coffee and she short changed u a sausage burritoso i bought another coffee even though i should not have had to pay for it because i wa in a rush she just had a really sour attitude and i know she probably doesnt like working there but it not my fault she accepted working thereso for that i give her a starhowever the next day we did come and the younger man wa in her place and he wa pretty much perfect got everything right great attitude no issue i give him a star', 'i usually dont have problem with this location even though i get irritated with their employee attitude sometimes today however my experience annoyed me more than usual because of the dumb people who work there the one worker

is just not friendly at all and can never get an order right when i drove up to the pick up window a teenage employee wa there and gave me my bag of food i ordered two combo i waited about second for my drink and he wa awkwardly standing there wondering why i didnt drive off yet then he asked are you waiting for something else that should be it i said we ordered drink too he look behind him and there are my drink oh he exclaims a i am situating the drink into my cup holder i hear him say here when i turn around towards the window half of his arm is in my car and the straw almost hit my face wtf i wa so irritated by his incompetency also one thing that i dont like is how two drivethru speaker are built but the employee are always confused by which one to use for example i would order at the first speaker when there is a long line i get stuck at the second speaker and a worker try to take my order there when i already ordered at the first one sometimes i tell them that ive already ordered and sometimes i ignore them even when theyre constantly asking hello are you ready to orderincompetent worker and a confusing drivethru so annoying', 'ok we have a consistent problem with this

not offer to remake the food i had to demand a refund from him and then asked if it would be remade and he said oh you want it redone this is the absolute worst mcdonalds and upper management should

the building thinking that we missed it at the first menu only to find that located at the second menu wa a big unlit sign stating that it wa personal facetoface service and we were to order at the windowreally we pulled up to the first window and no one wa there and neither wa there a sign stating to move forward to the next window we took the risk and pulled forward a few second later a lady wearing the supervisor uniform took our order while giving another employee a hug and having a conversation with another employee then we saw the car behind u paying for and placing their order at the first window then the lady who took our order came back with our food and wa trying to give u some change when she realized it belonged to the car behind u the food wa cold and oldvery confusing and

go unwarned of course i came to mcdonalds since i have those coupon for their new contraption the mcwrap which when i pronounce very fast and in my scottish accent sound much like mccrap after my second go round with this thing i have made up my mind it is decidedly so i need to write mcdonalds exec to change the name on this thing immediatelymy coupon for the day wa buy a medium fry and a medium drink get a mcwrap of your choice for free i have a hard time resisting free im here to tell youworst almost free meal of my life seriouslyit wa the tail end of lunchtime so the line wa still a bit busy i patiently waited for almost minuteswhich is like forever in mcdonalds time at least two folk left the line while i wa there i know it not mcdonalds fault but the couple in front of me took up majority of the line space because they were in motorized wheelchair and they were very loud this doesnt bother me much butthey were also very stinky yes stinky i have no problem with stinky in most case i occasionally help the homeless so i know but the guy in front of me hadnt washed in day if i were to guess to each his own and i know it almost summer so i know we all want to save waterbut damn if i get a whiff and i have to take a step back you might be stinky but who am i to judge i took a big step back and waited my turn free is the motivation here i finally get up there to the mcdonalds cashier and present my coupon to the guy he take a look at it and say we dont usually take the promo coupon at this location but well let you use it then he proceeds to put the coupon onto a stack ofmore coupon mind boggling to say the least he take my order of a medium fry and medium drink asks me what type of mcwrap i want grilled chicken bacon and ring me up later im given my receipt and asked to wait for my number to be calledi wait and wait obviously im and minute later i am still waiting honestly what the hell are you guy doing back there mixing the masa for my fresh pressed tortilla feathering a chicken perhaps ripening a tomato i ask the mcdonalds runner and he tell me were waiting for your mcwrap of courseat this point im almost running late to be back at work so the minute i get my order i bolt back to the office and have lunch at my desk thankfully im only three minute away i really really should have just gone to the vending machine or eaten my stash of reeses chocolate peanut butter egg from last easter talk about disappointment i take out my mcwrap from my bag and lay down the box of fry on my desk i continue working while munching away on what is supposed to be mcdonalds claim to fame their golden fry i bite into one eh a bit stale i bit into another one eh not enough salt i bite into yet another one eh cold i look down and whaddaya know my damn fry is not even barely cooked white like olivia wilde in the winter i look through the entire box and find at least half a dozen fry not cooked properly not golden brown not delicious barely out of their frozen state and just limp not acceptable please check my pic for proof of this travesty mcdonalds not doing their fry right is like ikea not serving their swedish meatball with gravy no buenoafter getting over this somewhat i finally hit my stride to go on to my grilled chicken bacon mcwrap wow talk about lightning striking twice this thing wa lifeless after unwrapping this beast the box is still the best part about this mcwrap i could just tell something wa off tortilla wa already showing sign of being soggy way too long the chicken peeking out of the top wa not looking tip top shape either after some hesitation i took a bite ugh i say ugh freshness wa not part of the gameplan for this mcdonalds today all cold and soggy and upon all my mcwrap wasnt built correctly instead of having spring mix like it supposed to there wa plain old shredded iceberg lettuce and my bacon wa missing in the word of our lord darth vadernoooooooo it wa mccrap through through totally upset over this one i have picture proof of this travesty of gourmet eats a well mcdonalds you have pissed off the wrong fatty i will definitely be calling your hotline to complain about this one for sure

a hotcake and sausage with extra butter and i asked for the extra butter repeatedly we waited the drive thru for a good minute because they were making our hash brown fresh so they said i get home and there is no parfait ergh called the restaurant and it seems like them screwing up at the drive thru is common place she took my name down and asked if i wanted to come back this morning or if she should add my name to the book now that one of my kid did not have their breakfast item i continued to go through the bag to find out that there is no extra butter and they didnt include the picante

money out ready to pay but because it wa an inconvenience for her to walk back to the first window she felt the need to argue first to top thing off they had the wrong order so i had to wait again for

understand how the fry can be cold and stale it absolutely defies logic yes there are time that the food come out hot it one of the reason i keep going back there nothing like hot fry from mcdonalds and also just because it mcdonalds like it or not it a staple for working parent too tired to cook dinner after work some night it is unfortunate that they have no competition in the immediate area to keep them on their toe otherwise they might actually try to improve their service and their product i am sure they are turning a profit no doubt it seems to always be busy however i truly believe that if any other burger joint opened up right next door this place would close down in a month every time i say im never going back i still do unfortunately tonight will be one of those night a the kid

i had already told her i threw it away she said she would just write down my name and put it in the book i take up the offer on a different day and they dont know what im talking about i pay but get home and the bun are burnt and the order wa wrong again i asked for no meat on the mcmuffin for my daughter and what do they add on meat yeah i can take it off myself but the point is is obviously they do not listen to there customer or just dont pay attention i mean every encounter there they always forget or simply make a mistake either way im taking my business else where management is not organized and you cant trust their word the crew is super nice though i didnt want to have to post this or the picture but they arent listening so maybe they need to see it pretty sure i wouldnt need a receipt now', 'this is got to be one of the worse mcdonalds ever even surpassing the mcdonalds in hawthorn nevadastopped there two time in two day i wa sick and didnt want to cook or get out of the

notice that i wa not fed at drivethru but fed in the interior my order wa wrong andi am ashamed to admiti did not notice they did not give me my coffee no exclamation mark needed and so began the

pay phone outside but it wasnt right outside the store it wa across the parking lot kind of in the bush and had some weird phone company that i never heard of on it plus it had an electronic sliding door on the main entrance and the play place wa outdoors and even had a sing that said please do not feed the bird such a weird place it cool because it reminds of the way mcdonalds wa when i wa a kid

it she tried to give me the size below what i ordered when i asked for the right size she practically insisted i take the smaller one then when my order wa up and i asked for ketchup she rolled her eye and acted like i wa making her go so far out of her way to reach under the counter then when i went to the fountain to get my drink there were small bug flying all around itbest part wa when i got

because we were tired after a long drive after watching some tv my husband said he wanted a little something from our local mcdonalds i wa not really hungry but i wa craving a little something sweet

minute later to break the news to me that they are out of butterfinger that wouldve been useful info to have when he first asked so i ended up with oreo he come back and i take a bite of my mcflurry

a few minute before am just in time for breakfast i wa the only person in the drive thru so i pulled right up to the menui waited for someone to take my order at the speaker but no one said anythingfinally an employee with an headset walked out of the back room of mcdonaldsi figured this wa because the order speaker wa broken or somethingbut no the employee walked over and flipped the menu from breakfast to lunchtimei wa thinking in my head whaaaaaaaaaaaaaatkeep in mind my car is right there im obviously waiting to orderthen the employee turned around and walked back into

a christmas miracle they had breakfast for metruth is i wa willing to leave mcdonalds with out my breakfast food i have a rule for myself i never fight with people that make my food behind closed door yea maybe paranoid but sadly it a reality so i wa completely polite about canceling my order i do believe they did the right thing by offering me these breakfast item where i find the problem is the simple lack of customer service that conversation of them no longer serving breakfast wa one we should have never had implying that my order wa an inconvenience when clearly it shouldnt have been so

and it wasnt in my bag when they gave me my orderyea this is a long review i would honestly be surprised if someone read down this far prop to you if you have but the whole reason behind it is that i

the day on the hike i ordered the large coke and hot spicy being a new mcdonalds this location is modern and for now immacuately clean first off it is a nice first impression when a mcdonalds is not part of a gas station like the one down the road at blue diamond and rainbow i entered through modern electric sliding door there were two manager and i got a nice greeting the worker were on top of their game there were plenty of booth to choose from the interior is more contemporary than mcdonald land the mcdonald playland is nonexistent what doe exist is a chandelier and a more elegant lobby

refill it is i wa really tempted to break out the credit card to pay for a refill just out of spite laziness prevailed and i walked away i can understand not having unlimited refill at a mall where

i had ordered nugget for speedy service and avoidance of excess carbsthe service today wa not a bad but why do they go through the trouble of asking what kind of sauce do i want with my nugget if they arent going to give it to me the guy at the window actually tried to shove me out of drivethru with only a partial order this particular instance ha happened several timesunfortunately i am a fan of their product and when i get a hankering and wish not to get out of my vehicle this is the closest locationi have managed food service installation and i guarantee that i could run that place better

at least that long before i try mcd again', 'every time that i go to the welcome screen on yelp i keep seeing your next review awaits with a picture of ronald mcdonald patting a man i dont know yelp want me to write the review and i am tired of seeing this when i go on the welcome screen so i will write a review on the mcdonalds in sam town when i write a review i try to look at a unique aspect of the business when it come to fast food restaurant it take some thinking what make this mcdonalds unique is that it feature the exact western motif displayed throughout sam town it is incorporated in a food court in back of the mountain where the robotic mystic fall robotic animal perform i dont know of any mcdonalds where i could grab a big mac and fry and watch a robotic cast of animal performing in a laser show what also make this mcdonalds unique for a location off the strip is that they do not honor the any size beverage promotion the sam town mcdonalds is one of a few food choice in sam town in my opinion i pas over their coffee and dessert for dunkin donut i pas over their lunch and dinner menu for the firelight buffet panda express and subway for my taste this mcdonalds is advantageous for a light snack or a large coke for the drive home the time i spend on the line justifies a checkin it is the mcdonalds of sam town and it get busy in comparison to a similar mcdonalds in the d casino the employee are friendly this summarizes my experience for the sam town mcdonalds yelp should be happy that i wrote the review and i should be happy to see a new picture on my welcome screen', 'manuel the manager gave u the worst customer service ive every had at a mcdonalds took our order incorrectly blamed u for it overcharged u wouldnt fix it and wa rolling

about also after getting home i find hardly any onion on the burger and out of the ordinary dry i hate to complain a i said the staff very respectful and friendly but the food definitely contradicts the attitude of staff very disappointed and regret paying for the food even at it low price sorry guy gotta be honest', 'i had no problem here everything wa present in my drivethru order and up to mcdonalds usual standard whether you love them or loathe them', 'they never get the order right and then i have never got the large fry i order they always put small in the back and the wait for all

remodel why bother making it all pretty modern if youre not going to wipe it down regularlythe service here is ok food is standard mcds fare the one reason we come here is for the huge fourstory play area the kid enjoy exploring it and i enjoy getting a half hour of sanity there a small space underneath for littler guy to play in but this playplace is realistically more for older kid who can climb well the kid room is completely closed off from the rest of the restaurant which work great at keeping my boy from running off and there a separate bathroom in here just for aparents no changing table which for some strange reason seems to be the way la vega restaurant roll i really hate that therefore they shouldnt be surprised when i change a poopy diaper on one of their posh bench seat since there nowhere else to do itmaybe then theyll wipe it down afterwards but dont count on it', 'a great place in the am and mid day at night the staff is rude and the place dirty it just seems like at

hand dryer wa broken i informed manager of this but they did nothing to rectify the at least one issue they could there are no paper towel just the hand dryer so one could be up the proverbial s creek without anything to clean up with nastyi also informed the same manager that there were spill one water one bubble in the play area but no one ever came to clean them and my daughter almost slipped through one of the spill they did not even put a warning sign out i also reiterated about the toilet paper and took it upon myself to place napkin on the sink the food wa not hot in fact barely warm

it a mcdonalds so what could i expect how about a clean space and staff that at least pretended to carethis store is close to the house and our grandson wanted his birthday party herethe store had a recent makeover and on first appearance is a very nice location they obviously spent some money on the makeover that is why the cleanliness or lack thereof wa rather shocking the dining area by the childrens play area appears to be an afterthought when they are cleaning i ended up cleaning our table myself since no one seemed to care enough to come wipe down table or throw away trash the food wa standard fare at mcdonalds but they were really slow filling the order and it wa only lukewarm when we got to the tablesthe play area also had one other major issue they have a little area with animal for the smaller kid to crawl around on i give them point for that and trying to keep the really wee one away from the bigger kid i would have thought that someone would have though of affixing the animal in some way so they would not tip over when the kid were on them a definite safety hazardnot a store i care to revisit luckily my grandson is now and his palate will soon outgrow mcdonalds',

really liked wa being approached in my car by the ned the homeless guy jed the homeless guy red thehomless guy etc you get the picture my windshield ha never been cleaned so many time', 'stopped in to feed the kid after the aquarium parking lot is relatively clean sharing a lot with a chevron we were greeted warmly when we came to the counter and everything seemed good halfway thru ordering a transient came up behind me in line to ask me for money the cashier ignored it then i noticed he subsequently asked every person in line behind me the counter staff wa not even showing any concern like we worked there food came we got in our vehicle and a different transient appeared inch from my passenger window asking for something the food wa good the service wa good just stay away if you dont like people accosting you for money', 'i literally left this location because of the screwy parking lot i just gave up and went to another mcdonalds on the way to where i wa going', 'i would be

long line in the drive thru or the order is messed up you say no cheese and they still add cheese', 'not the best mcdonalds ive been to service is kind of lacking and this area in general is pretty sketchy however it the closest mcdonalds to my house so to save gas i go to this one lately theyve been getting a bit better in getting their order right so hopefully it a permanent change', 'ive had my order messed up at this location out of time i would refuse to go but i love their iced coffee', 'a a whole this is a much nicer mcds then most ive seen and the quality seems to be pretty consistentcons caution read thisthat said the area is surrounded by government apartment and a guy wa parked outside of this mcds last week and stupidly had his window down and parked while writing a text msg on his cell when a guy put a gun to his face and made him drive home only to rob him fortunately he wa not harmed other than his pridemoral of the story be aware of your surroundings and keep your window up and door locked even in the drivethru line', 'we stopped by here on our way out of town to grab coffee etc let me just say ill never come back this place is completely sketchy there people randomly lingering around outside keep your window rolled up and your door locked while waiting my coffee wa warm but not hot a the outside label claimed it also tasted burned how exactly do you burn coffee overall not a place ill ever return and would not encourage anyone to visit', 'i think mc this location is quite different from another location that i had before the quality is not good enough i order big mc but it is not something that i had before by the way this restaurant serve me when i have not thing to eat', 'angus bacon and cheese thats the name of the sandwich it should come with cheese the first time', 'this location is really close to where i live and we go here all the time poor food quality at night you would think that the food would be fresher at night because of the slower business i ordered a filet of fish a few time from here and i recieved a stale fish sandwich and the fish look and felt so stale like it wa thrown away earlier in the day and dug out the trash and put on a bun my friend had gotten a double cheese burger and when she bit into and look at it a a piece of mop string in her burger that is disgusting we took it back got a fresh burger and fo a gift i guess they gave u free stale pie lol gotta love it', 'okay so we all know mcds isnt the tip top of cuisine but i like it when i am on the go and heading into work the people at this mcdonalds know me pretty well by now and always say hi where ya been when i havent been by for a while they also know what i order and comment when i do something different no kid meal today ha hai guess that make me predictable point being the staff here is friendly and the food is just mcdonalds', 'i give it only one star because they are slow and lazy for religious reason i dont eat pork so i choose the egg an cheese biscuit i end up getting handed a sandwich where they removed the sausage not happy', 'im not sure if the other reviewer went to this location because i found that they had friendly competent service and good quality food the restaurant appeared clean but the vinyl on the playplace booth wa badly ripped and should be replaced following the dfw tradition of themed

spanish food suck butt dont go to this mcdonalds youll have a bad experience and rude customer service', 'im not a big mcdonalds fan in fact i dont like their food at all but i wa with people who wanted to eat here so i wa captive i had an angus snack wrap which wasnt much more than a hamburger wrapped in a very small flour tortilla it wa actually pretty tasty but what i wa most impressed with wa the dinning room it looked more like an upscale english country hunting lodge plaid wallpaper brass chandelier and fixture with dark wood trim the only thing that spoiled the atmosphere of fine dining wa the playground with huge window and the scream of kid at play', 'this is not the mickey d you want to go to for fast service we ate inside and they got our order wrong and were super slow they need to hire more people at this location', 'i wa informed by the manager on around pm that this is a franchise owned mc donalds and they dont have to adhere to corporate protocol such a customer service and price the whole atmosphere reflects this man attitude it terrible i will never go back to this mc donalds location and in my opinion no one else should either the price are higher and the customer service is lower than the mc donalds on first st and beltilne rd garland tx joanne must work there this place suck smart a manager and all he gave me the website to file a complaint on what a joke', 'i wa craving fast food hadnt had it in week so i decided to try this mcdonalds on my lunch break the food sucked the nugget had no taste grease wa dripping from my fry the ice machine wa out

out burger instead', 'i feel like my father right now im not mad im just disappointed i cant believe i paid for an iced carmel mocha it wa gross and tasted like super sweet burned coffee it wasnt served with the typical cone lid and whipped cream and fancy looking swirl of chocolate and carmel on top either i even double checked when i received it and the clerk assured me in her best english accent that it wa infact an iced mocha wrong ive been ordering these for awhile and this wa not up to par i believe they charged me the higher price and just gave me an iced coffee i guess i should expect this from mcdonalds especially when their staff is still trying to master the english language i cant expect them to understand me and successfully complete my order can i keep looking for another morning caffeine kick or pony up an extra couple of buck for starbucks across the street', 'i guy named rodrigo identified himself like a manager on sunday morning he wa talking about a costumer dress in front of me with a crew member and messed up my order i asked to cancel my order and process a refund i dont tolerate a guy like this to make fun of girl in front of me he also suggested me to call to the costumer service number if had any complaint i am wondering if the operator is aware of this guy i am not coming back and also will suggest my wife do the same', 'eh it a mcdonalds that being said food wa hot and customer service wa actually far above what i would normally expect here it even seems clean', 'i agree with sameer usually mickey d is the same everywhere i think this one is a half step below the rest i also wa annoyed that there is no place to turn in from the opposite side of the street and you have to go down to lbj and make a u turn to get there',

that being said this wa awful i wa hungry late in the day yesterday and thought id walk next door to my neighborhood mickey d normally i have a hamburger and cheeseburger no fry no drink but today i had the asian salad with grilled chicken the chicken had this slimy goup all over it it made the chicken inedible a well a the salad beneath it my friend had a six piece chicken nugget and a fish fillet both were horrible my friend is a connoisseur of md fish fillet sandwich and he found it intolerable the nugget were devoid of their normal processed flavor which in this case is a bad thing

seem to have the mcrib how is this possible', 'this is quite possibly the worst mcdonalds around i walked into the door and wa welcomed by a big yellow cone where the lady wa cleaning the floor

another of their mccafe vanilla shake and a i reported in a previous review just after the mccafe line wa first introduced it still suck if you plan to take this home by the time you get there it will

at the bottom under the food when i arrived home the item were not there yesterday we went back and i had to ask for the syrup for the pancake and sugar for my tea the food lady said if you want condiment you need to tell the cashier because we do not have time to talk to you we are on a time limit to get the car out of the drivethru if you do not ask for the condiment while giving your order we will not give them to you this is such a sad state that the employee are so rude about their job and employer are so rough on getting customer through like cattle by the way mcdonalds when a person order pancake syrup should be provided without asking when a person order a biscuit butter should be provided without asking when a person order tea of coffee the order taker should ask if creamsugar

fancy location and it somewhat tedious to get in and out of but ive never had any food or service complaint i had one of their new cheddar bacon onion burger the other day and it wa very good although

inside and ask wth is wrong with them i am laughed at by the kid working there and no one can tell me that they did not make this sandwich like this intentionally bc of the way i requested it and to top it off this is the nd time this ha happened i threw a fit the mgr took my order again i told her i wanted her to make it these people arent worth the minimum wage theyre paid if theyre that stupid

very nicely there is a very spacious patio area with an hdtv you can watch game on it is situated directly adjacent to a very large soccer field that is often used unfortunately this mean that at night during game and practice the parking lot is mostly full due to people parking there for their gamesdo not let the parking lot fool you if there is a game in progress it probably not very packed at allanother thing relates to the free wifi they have the power outlet inside only under a large hd tv where they have comfortable chair set up this tell me they only want people using the internet over there and not at the table keeping the table open from a business perspective this is smart from a me being annoyed when i cant use my computer for a long time at a table perspective this suckedmy air conditioner went out one day and i needed a place to work i work from home i went to this mcdonalds and had so slump over my laptop all day under a tv blaring espnalso this place fill up

extra value meal and get a like sandwich key wordlike my option for my meal included either big mac or cheeseburger i order cheeseburger then for my sandwich i request additional cheeseburger the manager tell me no i can only get not duhhhi said why do u think like is emphasized in the wording again she said i can only get sandwich not fine of course then i looked for the biggest sandwich i could findthe bacon angus cheeseburger which i think may cost more than the value meal alone and quite frankly probably shouldnt be honored since it wasnt a part of the deal to begin with oh wellon top of that im still callin corporate to complainim entitled to my cheeseburger', 'tried the mccafe moca today pretty good not sure if i like it more than starbucks it about a dollar cheaper than

mcdonalds because well we all crave fast food every once in a while wouldnt you agree first off when did high school kid become so disrespectful mama kang would have definitely regulated on a few of them maybe backhanded a couple othersanyway i understand when you come to visit a friend at work you get a little chitty chatty we all do it but when it get to the point where you are just unaware of the line behind you then a slap to the back of the head is what you deserve i waited and waited for these kid who werent ordering to move out of the way so i could get my hamburger happy meal with some ice cream the employee their friend wa not even doing anything to get his friend out of the way so that he can assist the hungry people in line i waited a total of minute to even order which ha never happened before at a mcdonalds what made the experience even more aggravating wa the fact that an older woman with a manager badge wa not doing anything to diffuse the situation but instead laughed with the kid this isnt coming from a snooty tongue especially because im pretty easily pleased when it come to food and service but this wa a bit over the top we all know what mcdonalds taste like so i dont have to go into detail about thatoverall i cured my craving but this experience wa something to talk about in a bad way that i havent done in awhilelike i said im easily pleased also

minus the sausage with extra egg the wanted to charge me for that i work in the food service industry so i have an idea of the food cost so ill drive the extra mile and go to jack n the box not one more penny is going to the most successful over payed fast food franchise who begs for our money all the time for charity hope the egg and worst customer service wa worth losing the business that my friend and family gave you fyi jack n the box charge also but theyre way nicer and actually make it fresh thanks jack for hiring decent ppl could you train ronald', 'i work directly across from this place and go for coffee usually rarely the breakfast they always get my order wrong especially through the drivethrough be careful for overcharging and be specific with your order otherwise they will

drive through with some poor person blasting rap right behind me would choose any other fast food place over this location in particular do not eat here', 'this used to be one of the very best mcdonalds anywhere then the ownership changed apparently to corporate and the location ha not been the same since service is often hap hazard and the employee i guarantee will talk and talk and let you wait at the counter the interior of this mcdonalds is one of those unique one done up in black and white and while it is beginning to reflect it age when the place is clean still look good busy drive through a this is on a main plano street', 'very friendly staff they greeted me right when i walked in the door i also saw them checking up on people while sipping my coffee the interior ha great decor and the restaurant is clean the childrens play area is nice and there is plenty of seating for parent nearby i used their wifi connection while eating breakfast and it wa very fast very

you', 'we stopped at this mcdonalds because it wa on our way to my sister house the food wa good fast a always but i dont know why they took forever to brew up a pot of coffee plus they forgot i had

just absurd how hard is it to get an order right when it is just hashbrowns and honey mustard how much money do they make ezra by saving food and forgetting your food even though you pay then once we check we are long gone and too far to even turn around and waist our time to get our order right pathetic place you will always stay minimum wage because the simplest of thing you can not complete i

up to seattle being on a busy driving schedule we did the drivethru but wa greatly disappointed at what i goti think i made a simple order mcchicken sandwich with no mayo for myself and an oreo mcflurry for my son and a cup of water i have ordered mcchicken sandwich with no mayo at countless mcdonalds for the last year across the u and they get it right about of the timethis time however a i started munching on the sandwich while continuing our drive up i we noticed that both sandwich not only missed the no mayo request but both sandwich had double mayo both on top and below the chicken patty instead of a no mayo option i ended up with a quadruple mayoportions for the day it wa too late to go back and complain and request a correction i wa too hungry too so i just ate them both but felt my heart clogging up for the rest of the afternoonmy order did show up correct on the order confirmation screen in the drivethru window and the order did print up correctly on my receipt but the totally incorrect product turned up in my bag unfortunately ill call the feedback number on the receipt to report the incident so they can hopefully figure out where they went wrongi believe the rest of their operation is probably good but i am commenting on my specific incident here which wa my only visit to this mcdonalds', 'i come here often because it is very close while the people there are very nice and helpful i have the same issue every time i order it is always wrong always i ordered a chicken wrap plain no cheese crispy i get lettuce sauce and grilled i ordered fry and got apple slice this is just one of many error they make i would not come here again or recomend it this is the only location that get my order wrong that many time', 'the sherwood mcdonalds for a long a ive lived in the area is probably one of the worst fastfood place ive been to unfortunately in the interest of convenience and time constraint we end up running through the drivethru on rare occasionearlier this week they once again met my expectation for being incompetent apathetic and a waste of moneyi ordered a couple meal pc chicken nugget meal w hot mustard and a plain cheeseburgerhow many dipping sauce are you supposed to get with the nugget perwe got total using their new math i guess plain cheeseburger i guess at the sherwood mcdonalds that mean you really want a plain chicken sandwich because a chicken sandwich is what we receivedfries cold chewy no salt and the one medium fry wa filled half way i have a picture im attachingtheyve installed visual ordering screen in the drivethru but theyve managed to completely defeat that failsafe of the customer confirming what they ordered when the staff cant manage to pay enough attention to what they are putting in the bagsdo yourself a favor do not go to this place i never like to see business fail but in this case it would be doing the paying community a great service', 'fry are almost always limp and cold here ordered a coffee in drive through so did car ahead of me i wa told it would be done brewing in a minute and to pull into the waiting spot like the car ahead waited minute and finally car ahead

out of sherwood to get mcdonalds until new management', 'i apologize ahead of time to the owner for giving bad publicity to this mcdonalds but over the few time i have visited this location i have not had one good experience point for the double k to consider if a customer asks for a refund after waiting over minute for a piece nugget meal for their kid your manager should show some sort of logic when dealing with upset people maybe asking for the reason why a refund is being requested maybe even go so far a to motivate the employee to not spend the majority of their shift texting on their phone if your staff cannot handle the business from the counter and the drive through at the same time maybe not such a good idea to add another drive through lane another way to slam the staff with order they cannot fill within a reasonable time in the process of remodeling any of your location and there is no regular restaurant seating a suggestion to accommodate your customer during this temporary situation would be to keep the play place seating open until close so customer have a place to eat inthere are many more i could give but here are just a few suggestion from separate visit in hope the reason for this kind of service is due to you guy not knowing what go on in this restaurant', 'every few month i get this sudden urge to make terrible life decision like eating at mcdonalds or developing a debilitating drug addiction this location provided an extra bad breakfast experience and i probably should have just opted for some crack instead in retrospect even though i

commercial right before i pulled into the drive through whatever at any rate i did it for you i tried it so you dont have to turn out the chicken is different it moist the batter is appealing to the eye but a soon a you get one whiff you know thats some funky chicken i think maybe they reached a little too far with this one they tried to be too southern or too something and they screwed it up

game piece i called martha who manages the place to let her know whats going on she offered me the two game piece if i wanted to come back and get them which i refused because i do not want to drive

customer service job', 'i mostly do not go to mcdonaldsthen realized that when i do i always go here maybe it is the only game in town over this waybut in any event they have always been awesome hour

that are supposed to be part of the standard menu', 'this is the only mcdonalds near my work and probably for everyone else unless you you drive south into dt portland or go across the bridge tried to give this place a chance after a couple of screw ups but i just cant do it anymore and here whyone look at the storefront photo i uploaded that photo here at the time of this review but it wa originally taken early in the year mainly because i had another bad experience and i need to tell everyone not to come here any more because they suckso the first time a the photo show a dead small black fly on the lettuce in my classic crispy chicken sandwich i usually order it without mayo and when i got my sandwich the st time guess what it had mayo i just dont get why they cant read instruction properly or anything why cant the condiment be separate and not default it so frustrating any way nd time i got the sandwich they got it right except for the fly part i already went in my car so i said f it so i just took the picture a proof and then ripped the contaminated area on the lettucei didnt go to this location for awhile after this incident but i wa craving chicken mcnuggets and so since it isnt a fresh produce item or whatever i decided it wouldnt be a big deal boy wa i wrong i think this might have happened twice but i counted my nugget and it wa missing in the or piece meal i shouldnt have to count how many nugget i have but sadly these people cant do their job i dont even get much time to eat lunch so i didnt have time to go back and complain im done with this location any way so if im craving a sandwich or chicken mcnuggets from here ill just drive across the bridge and go there because it probably isnt crap like this location they know they are serving a ton of people since they are the only location but they just do such a bad job the fry are a bit overpriced too and some other thing in case any of you were thinking you can get a decent deal on large fry the best place for that would be the beaverton location near uwajimaya off highway i think thats itconclusion if you crave mcdonalds don t go to this location unless you want dead fly in your burgerssandwiches or missing chicken mcnuggets', 'stopped in the drive thru at this location for a mcdouble at around pm i asked for it to be made without salt on the meat when i get to the window the

in the evening there were a few car in front of me and i waited all of one minute at the window i ordered the supreme quarter pounder with cheese the largest fry and two apple pie it cost me just a little teeny more than eight buck service wa friendly helpful and reasonably quick honestly everything wa good quality in fresh the quarter pounder supreme wa very filling and tasty and the fry i honestly couldnt finish the only reason i havent given this macdonalds a star is because well it is fast food and it not like theyre making gourmet burger i got what i paid for and what i expected and wa pleased i would be happy to go back if i wa in the mood for this style of fast food', 'a mcdonalds that doesnt accept card stupida mcdonalds that doesnt accept card stupida mcdonalds that doesnt

of stale food we asked specifically for certain item to be left off the meal to which our request wa ignored we paid over for a meal that no one ate while attempting to give your location employee feed back they couldnt be bothered clearly my phone call wa interfering with their priority and their lack of concern only impact your bottom line we would never go backedited to add when you are told to wait so they can cook your food to make sure it newly made and fresh they should be able to stand by their word i wa lied to and while i waited an additional few moment clearly my meal wa not

mess up almost every time that must be why everybody ha such a poor attitude who work there they are so defensive from being yelled that all day long from screwing up you would think that would be humbling and you would be apologetic to your customer but instead you choose the road of confrontation what do you expect from somebody who qualifies for the same job a somebody who ha murdered people just got out of prison and dropped out of school in the third grade by the way this unhappy interaction wa with the store manager probably get beat it home so when she come to work it her time to have

and pretty much threw it at me without saying anything the other girl that hadnt acknowledged u but opened the window originally handed u our food and our drinksim pretty sure they were being rude to u because we hadnt paid at the other window but im pretty sure it not the customer fault that the employee at the register wa not at the registergood thing about franchise especially mcdonalds is that you can go to a different one if the staff isnt quite a rude a this one even if theyre still rude id much rather go anywhere else so sorry you made a mistake but dont take it out on u youre just

most ghetto neighborhood on the west side which say how the standard ha gone down if they really cared they would keep the restaurant clean inside and outside and i wa glad that i didnt see the inside of the bathroom because if it a ghetto mcdonalds the bathroom wouldnt exactly look like they were maintained well either i wouldnt bother eating here unless you want to be harassed by goofy hoodrats and crack fiend looking for someone to give them change i can think of at least mcdonalds location that ha staff that dont look like they were plucked from the ghetto garden because this mcdonalds seems to employ hoodrats and ghetto snot to work at this particular location i have gotten much better service elsewhere than this place i wont be coming here again and i want to be served by someone

including napkin when requested yes people eat out of their car giving me someone el orderthose are just the issue i remembered but there were probably others i never actually went inside to complain

waiting in the drive thru for someone to take my order but they took other car order first who were not even there when i first got there the first time i let it slip because i knew they just opened the second time i left but the third im leaving too', 'worst mcdonalds around fill the fry half way they have to be taught that because i have complained numerous time and the manager always say they

run this establishment i asked the young girl at the counter what their speciality wa and she told me the big mac wa one of their finer dish i placed the order along with some french fry i no longer call them freedom fry now that the french have come fully on board with our war against muslim country jesuischarlie i wonder how these french fry will be served i am imagining they will be garnished with black truffle i ask for their wine list and am told they do not have one how peculiar for a restaurant that serf french food to my horror no baguette either my food bill come to cent imagine that the big mac meal their finest offering and it is only just over dollar the wait is not long for my entree so glad i did not ask for their freedom onion soup strangely the food is in a box and a carton this must be a new style the creativity of chef these day know no bound i am impressed i open up the box and there lie this lettucey thing with some kind of salad dressing on it it is cold and damp this must be an artistic statement of some kind possibly a commentary on the ill treatment of the intuit native at the turn of the last century i am impressed by the chef social concern but i had wished that the food wa hot i took a bite i am glad that i sat close to the toilet a i made a run for it they must have been upset that i ordered the foie gras originally they are making me pay for it i know when i have been defeated my pomme frites were hot but lacking any french accoutrement this must be french cooking under the vichy government when the german took away their cream and tried to make them eat sausage completely defeated i made my way to the exit sign a i heard a cackle of teenage girl laughing at me a i tripped over the yellow wet floor alert signal this is the last time i

to go through drive through instead hoping for faster service we got to the speaker and the employee asks what do you want not a how can i help you or anything semicustomer service oriented we decided to order anyway because my daughter wa really excited for some fry otherwise we would have left at this point we placed our order and then pulled up to pay she told u one amount and then ended up giving me change for another amount however i didnt happen to check it until i had pulled up to the next window we pulled up to get our order at the nd window and the employee asked u what we had ordered not just an item or two so she could make sure we were the next order but she wanted to know everything we had ordered im not sure why there wa an issue in relaying the information from the st window to the nd especially with computer the nd window employee wa nice and even wished u a good day the order wa right and the fry were hot upon looking at the receipt the cashier did give me the correct change she just said the wrong amount when it come to ordering it really bother me when you walk into a restaurant that ha their breakfast menu up even though they say they are not serving breakfast anymore inside the breakfast menu wa up but they told others they were not serving it anymore in the drive thru we asked just in case because i really wanted a sausage biscuit but they said again they werent serving breakfast the biggest problem with this wa that because the breakfast menu were up the lunch menu were not and you would have had to know exactly what you wanted to get we

ordered i do not loiter and wa quite offended that this person insinuated that in fact i always order and take it home except this day i did sit for a a minute and earlier at breakfast i ordered my usual grub and sat maybe minute and took the rest home or two a i completed my call but i just got there and it wa like this person appeared out of nowhere and started grilling me what ever happened

mcdonalds is a waste of everyones time this mcdonalds however warrant special mention although the place is reasonably clean and they generally get your order right the length of time it take for this

for the last six month at least at this location and the one in union station and with the recent automation implemented you can expect to wait minute for a cup of coffee a another review said it probably because it doe seem like chaos to stand in a line deep place your order and then step aside in front of the people who ordered before you so the person fulfilling the order can shuttle to the counter back delivering your bag of food this actually got you your food pretty quickly even in peak timesso now the newest system is a single register to take order and an electronic system that show order number that are ready on a tv screen sound great right not at this location for some reason their fulfillment process is very very slow it took minute the other day for my order to come up and with the old system it would be minute consistently i think it wa faster because there were four individual team working on fulfilling order not a centralized mainly singlethreaded process with the new systemthis morning i walked in saw the line in front of the register wa deep and people were waiting for their order this isnt dekalb where a busload of people just walked in it mcdonalds and they

register and when i finally get to the front the person is running around without any clear direction running food to other register for the people who arrived after me but were lucky enough to win the register lottery multiple time i have had to get someone attention and remind them that i am still waiting to place my orderits not rocket science heck it not even science it service plain and simple divide and conquer one group of people take order and another group of people run the food while yet another make it in the back sound simple right well it doesnt appear so simple when you walk into this mcdonaldsi have worked in the food service industry a a waiter and i understand that people have different idea on what is good service but one thing is always constant greet your customer and communicate with them let them know if youll be a minute inform them if there a wait whatever the issue just let them know theyll appreciate you more for it and be more willing and patient to waitother than the service this is well mcdonalds doesnt matter which one you go to you get pretty much the same thing thats the hallmark of their business the only difference is serviceso pay

who have had bad experience will take the time to write a review which i dont think reflects very well for how many people they serve at lunch from lane tech student to nearby worker to family i think theyve done a pretty consistent job at being quick and having the food taste good for mcdonalds standardson the downside drivethrough ordering ha a bit of an awkward setup especially if you want to head left after you leave they also tend not to accept a lot of promotional coupon the quality of the food dip a bit after lunch', 'crappy female manager who argued with me when i dared to return a grilled chili chicken wrap which these idiot added mayonaise oh you need to tell u no mayo when you order oh do i also have to tell you to make sure the food is hot and not appearing a though a ton

lady wearing a thick coat and scarf the summer before i brought my neice to play in the playhouse and it wa hotter than heck in there when i asked for airconditioning they said it broken about a week

made right when handing me the bag he waved the receipt in my face something i never received a copy of and told me it is right now because i have your receipt i would expect it to be right only to

a luxury because my parent highly frowned upon processed and can food a a rebellious child growing up eat at a mcdonalds wa luxury the closest place without a car had to be in mckinley park fast forward a few year and the mcdonalds express opened despite it being fastfood it pose a a treat to all the local in the neighborhood after playing sport at mcguane or just grabbing a quick bite this mcdonalds is very small compared to other mcdonalds but they do serve most item since they marketed their menu couple of year ago the dollar menu ha never changed mcchickens and mcdoubles were always a now with the advertised breakfast menu and any size drink there are a lot of cheap option my only grievance is that they dont have sweet tea and salad but unsweetened tea is available it doesnt feel right to goto any mcdonalds for a salad it just doesnt make sense to mei come here a couple time a month for ice coffee hot coffee and a sandwich or two the location is convenient to grab a quick bite pick up my dry cleaning or pick up a few small item from walgreens the occurrence of panhandler ha increased since pacific garden mission moved to canal st and it ha also died down since the new

appeal under a bleak and cold chicago evening all thing being fair the culinary experience wa doomed for failure given certain personal and tragic circumstance i wont get into hereupon stepping to the counter i gave pause to the abbreviated menu not worthy of a mcdonalds express which is a new concept to me alltogether i decided to play it safe with the classic cheeseburger meal with an intimidating amount of fry and drink aka the value meal my meal wa served up a little too quickly with all due credit to the server the food seemed to appear from nowhere gremlin cooking the food i could see the grease seeping through one of the burger wrapper at this point i made a snap substitution request no coke coffee instead a hot beverage will make the grease go down smoother my server obligated me in silence and i acknowledged her generosity i took my tray and chose a seat by the front window where parked car would treat the diner with blinding light from their headlight but at least it wa somewhat devoid of the cold glowing light emitting from the overhead florescent located in the rear of the restauranti sat down and emptied the content of the bag fry and napkin no ketchup i tasted one of the fry to determine if they were worthy of ketchupfree consumption but ala no they were slightly cold with a texture that left an unpleasant lump in your throat i fetched several ketchup packet from the server kept under tight security behind the counter and returned to my tablespilling out the ketchup packet on the table i noticed dried droplet of ketchup on the plastic packet no turning back now i dug into my dinner with a overwhelming sadness for humanity and myself so to sum upfries they left an odd taste of seafood or fish to my palette perhaps they comingled food in the fryer the lukewarm temparture made it a bit difficult to choke them down maybe some beer would have helped the processcheeseburgers lifting the top bun of any burger you can tell right away if there wa any love in the preparation though consumable the burger were not satisfying and tasted a if they sat under a heat lamp for too long also lukewarmcoffee i have tasted better coffee from a mechanical contraption in a corporate lunch room it wa watery lukewarm and slightly sweet in a way that amplified everything that went wrong with the coffeeketchup packet look like they were dropped on the floor at some point or recycled from a previous diner that did not use up all their ketchupcustomer service no complaint here it not exactly the most cheery place to work server were speedy helpful and responsive', 'this is a mcdonalds express so it sadly doesnt have the entire menu at all time it reminds me that advertisement often include participation and availability may vary

of the time ive been in here no matter how busy ive had my food handed to me in le than minute from paying for it thats express peoplethe only thing that drag this place down is the atmosphere the counter is tiny and only hold two register so at any busy point in time the line of people engulfs the only walking space and make it way to the door and sometimes extends out the door though ive only seen that during dinner time a ive passed by on my way home from unique or somethingthe soda machine ha once or twice been low on syrup yielding a nasty beverage but it outside the counter so you can refill it with something else on your own the table for sitting are very close together meaning it difficult to eat your food in peace at this location without being bothered by someone family issue or rampant child it can get very loud herebut all in all if youre stopping in for something to go this is a great place for that just make sure to check that what you want is on their smaller menu and take note that sometimes the sale regular mcdonalds can have on menu item doesnt necessarily apply here so pay attention and then you can enjoy your mcdonalds foodand youll enjoy it better at home

so often the drive up is a nightmare so they lost a point whether it morning or night there always a long line i normally park on the residential street and walk over inside it been newly remodeled from a few year earlier everything is affordable and there even a dollar menu ive found the customer service here just average my last incident the supervisor wa rude about a request i made to my order so they lost another point there i get that they are unpaid and overworked but i didnt pick this job for you hun and not everyone eats the same', 'im not a big fan of mcdonalds but once in a great while ill go the four time that i have gone there in the year i live in this area they have gotten every single order wrong the last straw wa today when i wa in a hurry and got home only to see a wrong order i checked it when they first gave it to me all wrapper look good get home open wrapper and they arent the right sandwich i drive all the way back ask for a manager told her this happens every single time she got me the right order but no apology a of matter of fact she said nothing at all never again dont go to this location', 'this mcdonalds ha the worst service of any that i have visited in the world and i mean that quite literally cold food incorrect order after long wait time price on their own menu not even being honored the list go on and on in fact they automatically

itany way you want itthats the way you need itany way you want itsweet fucing chili sauce thats what inspired me to break into journey song and rave about this particular hour mcdonalds i did a serious uey when i saw the sign boasting that the new sweet chili sauce wa here deliciousoi smothered that sauce all over my southern style crispy sandwich it wa amazing', 'i am going to be a connoisseur of everything mcdonalds very soon i didnt realize how many i have been too until they kept popping up in my feedokay thats not why you came to this review to read me ramble on about nothingnow this mcdonalds is clean and although there is sometimes a language barrier when i go i still go back because the food is always fresh and hotthe last time i went though they ran out of canadian bacon for the egg mcmuffin which wa on sale buy one get one free and instead of allowing me to get another sandwich in it place i wa just told i had to order something elsei thought that wa wrong since they are the one that couldnt keep up with demandother than that i have no complaint and i have never had a problem with this mcdonaldsi noticed all the other review were from year past so a a customer that come to this one a lotthis mcdonalds is aok for me', 'breakfast stop at am i had no idea ggrrr', 'so my first experience with this mcdonalds wa the day that i moved in i had a couple friend helping me this mcdonalds is directly across the street from my apartmentso after witnessing a guy smash his van we later were told by the popo that it wa stolen into the light pole right at the corner then watching him exit the vehicle and run maniacly down north ave away from the scene we decided we were hungry we thought why not go to mcds seems logical i mean mcds is always the same no matter where you go right and it wa certainly conveniently located at least it appears conveniently located oh it not attempting to cross north ave at my intersection is really a situation where you are taking your life into your hand this is a oh hell i dont even know how many corner there are here intersection and one of the light is only green for one side of the street but ha no sign indicating that anywhere so people either dont stop or just stand there you feel like you are playing frogger except not with a pixellated frog but rather with your own skin and organsif you make it into the building with your spinal cord still attached to your body you will see they always have at least people working here yet there are never more than register open at once and the only people working those register are either a ancient nonenglish speaking woman b mentally handicapped hey i appreciate their sense of social responsibility to hire the old and degenerate i do not appreciate the game of charade i must play with the cashier to get my order rightwhile you are waiting the plus minute it take to get your food here you may notice that this mcdonalds is a bit different from the rest ricky martin picture signed selena cd and gigantic enrique iglesias are the decor of choice here apparantly this is the latin rock n roll mcdonalds couple that with the fact that it the only mcdonalds i have ever seen that ha jalepenos a a condiment and the fact that they look at me a if i am lost every time i walk in there i think it safe to say the clientele here is pretty setoverall the location service and neighborhood suck i would give it only star but hey it open and it mcdonalds', 'at a time when people are finally realizing that we must eat healthy to be healthy mcdonalds make no move away from their overly processed junk food this mcdonalds is focused on car and it parking lot is twice a big a the restaurant go to the la perla tapatia which is right next door', 'never thought id write a review about a mcdonalds but i feel compelled this one wa just rebuilt replacing a perfectly servicable old one whatever it their moneymy problem with the new one is that it parking lot configuration and ease of ingressegress is even more stupid than the old one if thats possible you see if youre coming from the east entrance into the lot either via entrance on north avenue or lowell one way north is no problem if youre coming from the west on north avenue or from the south on kostner you literally cannot enter the parking lot at all i thought by turning left onto kostner a fairly maindrag kind of street i could enter a you could with the old one nope no entrance any more on kostner and you cannot turn left from north avenue to lowell because there a median i think either way youre risking an accident or a ticket there an alley directly behind the lot which is not only fenced off from mickey d but one way going out so i drive around the block past lowell the oneway street next to mcdonalds to kildare back to north avenue then enter jesus the entrance ha one of those dividedcurb thingys which wa barely wide enough for my compact car there are two drivethru lane from which to order food but then they merge into one waiting line so you can end up in this single line ahead of someone who been waiting longer or viceversa so why bother the rest wa standard mcdonalds why cant you at least offer me salsa for my breakfast burritoi got no sauce no ketchup no napkin nuthinok then to get out and go back east on north avenue you must basically repeat the mazebullshit from above only in the reverse you used to be able to exit onto kostner then turn left on north avenue now you are forced to either go west on grand or north avenue or go to lowell north to wabansia past a high school to kildare to north avenue got all that apparently the city think it more desirable for u to drive around an entire neighborhood than to use the only inexplicably oneway alley in the entire neighborhood to get home from fucking mcdonalds i felt like rat in a ghettomaze only with a soontobecold egg mcmuffinso in a nutshell if you live west of here you cant get in if you live east of here you cant get out and ya cant really go north either it maddening if you must go to this mcdonalds walk or take the bus seriously from my house at the halfway point between the two i will just go down to the one at kedzienorth i realize mcdonalds andor the city are trying to protect themselves from lawsuit from our shitty driving and that badly designed intersection but if it that dangerous which it is then just dont build it there it a square lot yet needlessly complicated grrr', 'drive thru is clueless customer service leaf a lot to be desired i must be honest and state that i have only passed through here for a happy meal for my son or a coffee they have managed to screw both of those up some language barrier exist before you judge i am bilingual

wanted', 'i had surgery on friday and i figured a sausage biscuit would help me have a bowel movement since im on pain med and that say a lot about how i feel about the food here so i begged my bf to

convenience will often nudge itself up to be one of the weightier consideration when trying to manage dinner when i dont have time to make dinner but with this mcdonalds i get apprehensive driving into the parking lot because i know there is going to be an chance of a wrong order from here on out im going to smack convenience across the face if it encourages me to go to this mcdonalds', 'i dont care if the owner is my next neighbor or he life in malaysia if you cant consistently give people what they ordered you suckive been here about time once i think my order wa correct on the other time were not talking about forgetting the napkin oh no were talking about gross deficiency in cookingprep or were talking about forgetting a cheeseburger or a happened to me yesterday leaving out an entire pack of chicken nugget and the sauce i understand screwing up every now and then but enough time to be a theme id rather the place be run by cold fascist and get my order righti live a few block away but have no plan to go back there other mcds around and the cost of the gas to drive there will be made up by the increased chance that ill actually get the crap food i paid for', 'normally i wouldnt take the time to rate a mcdonalds a the product is relatively consistent across all location however this location is terrible and deserves to be called out a such this location is the closest to my home and a a result i would go here frequently when the mcdonalds urge arose no more every time i pull in to this place it seems quicker to head inside rather than sit in their slowly creeping drive through only to find out upon arriving home they failed to include an item in my order the employee are an unmotivated bunch who doesnt seem to care about customer service cleanliness

parkthey really need to remodel the staff though you dont expect these folk to be rocket scientist like jackson r but a simple order for two people shouldnt have three mistake i love their asian

cute golden m they sell kid meal so dont be alarmed it fun for the whole familythey have excellent softserve ice cream cone and strange tasting yet authentic cultural salad i recommend the snackwraps', 'very poor service and super slow i hate going to this location', 'still a trashy location but it ha been verified that drug deal do go on there so youll have something interesting to

difference she outright refused to give me the correct change and basically told me i could pick it up she claimed she wa the manager and then threatened to call the police i have never in my life had

okay but a couple of people during my minute there i overheard complaining about how they had skimped on ketchup packet thats th one gent said serious', 'i went thru the drive thru so you expect low

worst over all service is always slower than normal today visit i wa only customer and they couldnt get the order right i love mcd but not this one', 'this is the worst location ever i refuse to go to

order wa simple but we had to repeat it multiple time in response to whaaa coming from the order box then when the voice from the box repeated our order it wa wrong then when we went to the pay window they asked if our order wa correct and it absolutely wasnt then when we went to the food window we asked for ketchup and were told it wa in the bag we dug in found no ketchup but a ton of salt packet luckily my boyfriend is a ketchup hoarder so we had a bunch of little packet on hand overall the debacle started off comically difficult and ended up disappointing and a bit enraging mostly i wa mad because we were lied to the ketchup wa a lie now i cant lie ill probably be back because my expectation for mcds arent too high and i like french fry', 'this review is for the shamrock shake onlyits brighter green than i remember an extremely unnatural shade of green that doesnt occur normally in nature for a unnatural the color is the flavor is just a fake i dont think there is any actual mint or dairy in these thing i think they are petroluembaseddoes it taste different than it used to definitely a few year ago mcds did the unthinkable they ditched their old shake recipe for a new fastercheapereasier shake system basically a neutral vanilla shake come out and different flavored syrup are mixed in at the last minute the result is a subpar product syrupy and too sweet it not even mixed when it come out it like those thousandflavor ice cream joint that do the flavor syrup yukis the shamrock shake disgusting yesdo i kind of love it yesthe shake dont taste too horribly different they are similar enough to the old recipe to still be ok in my book do i feel dirty for eating one yesdo i now want to vomit yeswould i recommend the shamrock shake to the casual observer totally',

the thing about which we gripe will be first world problem wont theyanyhow my wife wa hungry one evening so we stopped here to grab a bite to eat through the drivethru we actually enjoy eating at mcdonalds in general and think the food is good some people will probably find that statement more offensive than the above comment about terminology so it not like this wa a bad option we actually used to stop at this one pretty often on our way home from church when we lived on the east side and we generally received great serviceunfortunately tonight wa a night on which we received awful servicewhen we pulled up to the drivethrough the mcdonalds employee let loose with this rapidfire barrage that wa presumably supposed to tell u what food wasnt available im a teacher and im used to decipheringbut this wa incomprehensible of course when we mistakingly ordered something that wa deemed offlimits we were made to feel like buffoonsafter we finally managed to figured out what wa available we ordered and pulled up to the window you dont need a crystal ball to figure out what happened nextthats right they got the order partially wrong one of my wife chicken mcnuggets even wound up outside of the container perhaps it wa in a hurry to escape an environment completely void of any sort of concern for the customer or perhaps they couldnt be bothered to take an extra second to close the container fully ill let you be the judge on that one they also gave her the wrong sauce i had no idea that sweet and sour actually mean barbequewhy we stopped at this mcdonalds instead of

today when i visited i thought hmm ill be smart this time ill go inside to beat the line drivethrough line wrapping around the building well i should have known better inside the line snaked to the door just two foot from where i entered the restaurant they had one woman on the register and she wa moving at a snail pacei waited for a full minute yes im an idiot and still hadnt even gotten to place my order in fact there were still five people in front of me frustrated and hating myself for giving this place yet another shot i left without food and vowed never to returnthe sumitup i really

clean inside at least when i went though we actually had to ask someone where the trashcan wa since it wa hidden around a corner ketchup dispenser wa broken and they gave me sweet and sour sauce instead of sweet chili like i asked now i usually dont review fast food since it pretty much the same no matter where you go but this is the location closest to my house and i can honestly say i rarely ever go because of one thingthey are sloowwwwww in the drive through expect to wait around minute i even had two people behind me decide to leave after they had ordered and i wasnt the one holding up the line i ordered a spicy mcchicken and nugget i even considered if going inside would have been faster bottom line this isnt the place to go if you want fast', 'the drive thru wa very

back from the woodland so i just decided to swing through the drive thru to grab some food hoping it would help my headache there were two car in front of me when i pulled into the line one car wa at the pick up window the other wa at the intercom to order it didnt take long for the car in front of me to order when it wa my turn i literally sat there for minute without anyone acknowledging me usually if the employee are slow they will at least say hello and then ask for a moment to help other customer i wa about to yell into the intercom to make sure they were in fact open people were pulling up behind me and i wa losing my patience finally some lady came on the intercom and said what can i get you a if they were the one waiting on me to decide i could hear a lot of noise in the background sounded chaotic i asked for a grilled chicken wrap she responded with we dont have grilled meat wait yeah ok grilled what else then i asked for sprite were out of sprite ok please give me unsweet ice tea ok sweet tea at that point my headache wa so bad i didnt even try to ask for the frickin unsweet tea then she told me to drive forward without telling me a total a im waiting to pay and get my food i see at least two car leave the drive thru line because theyre fed up with the poor service when i got to the window the lady even made a comment about it ooooh look at all those car leaving im sorry but if you are aware that you are losing customer maybe you should step it up a little bit and get your shit together so you dont lose customer she couldnt have cared le it wa patheticluckily i dont live in that area so im hoping to never have to experience such slow horrible service in a drive thru this wa by far one of the worst experience ive ever had', 'will not return to this establishment', 'sooo i wa in a rush and stopped here before work i ordered a sausage mcgriddle with egg white and ended up with a nasty dry sausage biscuit with cheese it wa in a huge crumpled bag so the thought crossed my mind that it wa returned by somebodymaybe the parking lot is impossible to get through with people driving the wrong way so i didnt bother driving back anyway super annoying when youre on a schedule good thing i left some banana on my desk because i cant eat thisoh and the other two time i stopped in for coffee the machine wa broken they charge almost a much a starbucks for a latte that taste like it wa made from a powdered mix and the machine is always downseriously', 'service here is way below average even for a mcdonalds the bar set is not high to begin with enough said', 'this location is about average a far a mcdonalds go their playground tends to be closed often due to broken equipment or most recently broken door leading to the playground so if youre planning on taking a group of young child you might want to check ahead of time to make sure the playground is available i do like the fact that it one of the few in the area that still have an outdoor playground but the lack of cover for outdoor table make eating outdoors rather unpleasant all in all it okay and the convenient location in the neighborhood make it a regular stop unfortunately some of the employee are more interested in chatting with one another than serving customer and if you have a group of people paying separately but eating together there is an annoying tendency to refuse to take your order at the same time meaning the first person food is cold by the time the last person is servededit i ate at spicy mcchicken sandwich from the value menu around pm on and within hour wa doubled over with food poisoning i cant say that it came from the sandwich or course but i can provide this information and let others draw their own logical conclusion', 'i normally try to hit up this location when im at the sam gas station across the parking unfortunately i normally stop for gas in the morning and this location is a nightmare at that hour the drivethru

quality of servicefood granted it is in a good location near the reliant and allbut omg food is gross drink are gross coffee is watered down flat soda not very sweet sweet tea and horrible service

hard it is to slap a piece of fake meat onto a bun and throw the correct condiment onunless you cant read the ticket which honestly wouldnt be surprising there is one employee who every time we go just happens to take a break sit in a chair near to u and scream yell bitch and cuss to her heart content on her cell phone i dont care if your on a break you still represent your workplace because you are still wearing the uniform and sitting in the lobby after the fourth time in a row of seeing this we decided we would never return there are a few other location nearby i suggest you choose them instead', 'horrible service our cashier wa no where near friendly the only reason i gave this mcdonalds star wa because the supervisormanager stepped in to be nice other than that i would have given it a star', 'horrible saw weed in the bathroom stall make sense a the employee always get my order wrong so theyre probably blitzed lol funny but truethey charged me for a salad when i ordered a burger and then took minute to realize they could just give me cash back because they couldnt refund a card y idkbe prepared to wait forever check your order before u leave the only reason they get star is the morning staff theyre decent', 'awful service ordered my meal in the drive thru paid for it get to the pickup window to be told they were out of chicken okay rude employee that gave me

when i order clearly voice jalapeo burger and they come back with ok fishfilet and a chocolate shake uhanyways the reason i give this place run by incompetent neuron is because i wa excited that our area bridgelands cyrpess lake had a easy spot for morning coffee breakfast but to be so inefficient and consistently missing crap it just ridiculousi mean without fail every single time i go there im seriously not exaggerating and we go maybe once or twice a month so not very often but every single time thing are missing and not just sauce packet i mean seriously goofy obvious thing my kid seem to always miss a juice box in their happy meal and gogurt and when i say always i mean literally always ive had drink missing the dude at the drive through looking at me with deadeye and im looking back like dude i have a mocha frappe thats kind of obvious wouldnt it beanyways i digress all in all this place suck but you cant expect much when it run by a bunch of goofball kid that dont care and a

specifically ask for fresh fry shame on them', 'after reading the other review i realized my case wa not isolated burger and fry were only warm would have taken them back wa too hungry table and floor

underdelivered and im honestly beyond frustrated at this pointi moved to an apartment complex near this location and started out visiting a few time a week out of convenience after my first or visit i started to realize that it would be much more likely that id win the mcdonalds monopoly game than receive the basic accommodation offered by most mcds ive watched a manager get into a verbal altercation with customer admittedly an unruly customer sweet tea ha been made available le than in visit table are rarely cleaned during peak hour the ice machine tends to run more like a water fountain and most importantly the guest service is terrible im largely content with mcdonalds at large but this is not like any mcdonalds experience youll ever see elsewhere the receipt dont come with a tell u how were doing number so i made my concern available to corporate after having to research the number on my own after my call to corporate the local management team reached out to me they

different if they didnt have my sauce ughhh thats so annoying', 'just went through the drive thru unlike prior review there were no problem at all we ordered a couple of mcdoubles and a medium drink

for ketchup because there wa none in my bag i literally had to knock on the drive through window when it wa slammed shut in my face to be begrudgingly granted a measly two packet of ketchup i really

which order they are on and it always end the same with cold food or the order is wrong after a terrible experience one night recently at at night with pp ahead of me i waited more than minute got up to the window and they had to ask for my receipt to know what my order wa and it wa colder than cold when i left i thought i wa done then but on my way to work wa in a hurry and drove thru for a simple sausage and muffin nothing else they confirmed my order once again waited far too long esp in the am got to the pay window took my money and then closed the window on me waited for her to open

large drink each when i got to the food window i wa given one large drink and one medium when i complained and said it wasnt what i ordered the guy at the window looked bewildered he said he couldnt fix it because the automatic drink machine wouldnt allow him to manually pour another one then when i asked well cant you just go get me another one he said i cant leave my spot then i countered with well can you get someone else to do it he said uh i cant leave my spot i can give you a cup and you can come inside to get it yourself what i went through the drivethru because i had just come from

find that it wa packed and i had difficulty getting to the front to request a new coffee the entire experience took about minute im not hating on the employee here or anything but it wa still a

wrong i dont know why they dont take debit or credit card after a certain time they always ask for cash i find it odd thats all im saying some of the people i dont trust they look shady a hellthis mcdonalds is so odd', 'many many late night munchies have been satisfied at this establishment other people complain about how they sometimes dont have everything in stock ive only run into that situation or time since im not that picky when it come to fast food beggers cant be chooser imo i usually order a simple burger so theyre bound to have that in stock my friend always get salad so sometimes theyre out of the kind he usually get but again that ha happened like or time at mostas for the food even late at night the food is served hot so im definitely satisfied there inside is just like any other mcdonalds with an indoor playpen for kiddy overall i havent had any bad experience with this place other than the occasional homeless person walking up to your car asking for money when youre sitting in the drivethru at am but that ha nothing to do with mcdonalds you can run into homeless people anywhere', 'this is the mcdonalds that my friend and i always go to since it the closest to our apartment but at the same time it definitely the worst one ive ever been toone plus is that their drivethru is open hour but sadly the later at night you go the more often your choice are limited for example one day we were craving their vanilla cone but they said that their ice cream machine wa off already so they couldnt make it okay whats the point of staying open hour if you cant even give the customer the food they wantthe other day i had a pretty bad dinein experience the lady behind the counter charged extra for big mac sauce on the mcdouble which i have never experienced before usually going through drivethru they never charge extra for a mcdouble wo the ketchup w big mac sauce and shredded lettuce aka a big mac but cheaper my boyfriend and i were pretty shocked when she told u we had to pay extra for the sauce and she claimed that they always do this which they really never dothen this same lady proceeded to close the cash register before giving me my change she told me to wait on the side so she can give it to me after she open it for the next customer so i patiently waited and then she closed the cash register again after the next customer and totally forgot to give me my change so i had to remind her again to which she just laughed and semiapologized and then finally gave me my change after like a decade of waiting argh worst mcdonalds worker ever completely rude and horrible customer service skill i totally agree with my boyfriend who said this mcdonalds is very poorly managed he even wrote a complaint to them a while back but they never responded we love to see you smile i beg to differ', 'so incredibly peeved i went to the drivethru to grab a quick lunch before i went into the office i bought cheeseburger and when i got to my office i found there wa only one cheeseburger this wa supposed to be my lunch the sticker on the bag that say double checked for accuracy is just laughing at me right now either they didnt double check it or they dont know how to count i dont understand the satisfaction of scamming cent from customer but whatever make you sleep at night i guessthe only reason i ever go to this mcdonalds is because it close to usc and close to my apartment i really dislike this mcdonalds really really dislikeoh and you will almost always get homelesshobos loitering outside asking you for money', 'pretty nice mcdonalds one of the nicer one ive been too and the food is solid mcdonalds quality service is a little slow however but waiting for chicken nugget or a mcflurry is totally worth it great place for a quick bite around usc', 'every single time i come here they take forever it is seriously the slowest fast food joint i have ever been to it shouldnt even be called fast food in this case and also the last two time i went which were in the past month i dont usually go to mcds i swear they forgot my order i literally waited minute and the worst thing is that the worker there seem very reluctant to help you so make sure you show them who bos and demand your fkin food that they fkin forgot i forget about how shitty they are when i get my food tho because im glad the food is always hot and fresh and the nugz are crispy i hate stale nugget ahemlax but honestly besides the shitty service and blah worker this is def one of the nicer mcdonalds out there it usually pretty clean and they also have a humungo playplace thing for kiddos also everybody come here on thurssat night cause who doesnt love a drunk mcdonalds meal and if youre a creeper you can check out all the girl in slutty outfit coming from the row ha i can see the mcds sign from where i live at usc too so obv i do come here still with the shitty service i think itll be smarter to do drive thru next time that way there no way they can forget my order muahahahaha lol', 'i stumbled on the review for this mcdonalds which i already frequented many time i want to put out a good word for them because i think the rating is lower than what it is supposed to be speaking from my own experience the staff are fine though sometimes they are not clear in the speaker food is good a well i went there at least once a week', 'considering it in a pretty crappy area i could not give this place more than star additionally it is mcdonalds i went to the drivethru the other morning to get an iced coffee and they were pretty busy which is good however if you are in a hurry and need to get to usc or your work place i would not recommend coming here because it always seems to be packed anyways it mcdonalds it not much different than the others', 'well we all know the quality of food at your standard mcdonalds and this one is no differentthe only thing of note about this mickey d are it is open hour a day which is a very convenient thing when it come to late night food run it must be the slowest mcdonalds ever i cannot tell you how many time i have sat in that drive thru for upwards of minute even at it fastest it is still super slow', 'there is usually atleast one person asking for money outside which make me not want to go here which incidentally is good and bad', 'this is one of my favorite place that my kid have enjoyed going to enjoying coming here for year even before they were born i remember when their used to be a bridge like castle playground it wa really fun for them and i also enjoyed going through the maze with both my kid now this is a hour drive through and dine in also the one on glenoaks blvd and western in glendale', 'is it possible to put no star in this branchi mean this place is probably in the top ten list of the worst mcdonalds franchise in historythey always screw up our order it either a missing burger or the wrong side item whats really bad is you trust them to do it right and you discover that the order is messed up when you get home so you go back right they give you the missing item and simply say there you go sorry no bonus no here something to make up for our crappy service nothing like thatthey will not give you ketchup or napkin unless you ask for it so if you forgot youll be eating your fry a isif you order a combo they would ask you medium or large a if small is not an option very trickywhen you order a breakfast meal they would ask do you want to have orange juice instead of coffee a if there is no difference in price and you have the option of choosing juice over coffee without extra cost they will never tell you that should you make the mistake of choosing orange juice you will pay a lot more for the stupid upgradeis this how mcdonalds became the most successful franchise by tricking their own customersdont bother to talk to the people in there nobody care', 'coffee breakfast dealthe endjust drivin thru just drivin thrubonus across

experience at ish pm wa just because youre a fast food place that doesnt mean you dont greet customer a hello good evening or sorry for the wait something that let me feel a lil better for spending my hard earned cash at this establishment anyone that work retail know how much customer sevice is pushed management at this mcdonalds should consider retraining teach these employee the basic working with the public being a cashier isnt easy you deal with unsavory people with crappier attitude sometimes but you still want your customer to leave happier not upset', 'very sllloooowwwww drive thru service the slowest ive ever experienced i would avoid this mc donalds if youre in a hurry some people just left the line avoid', 'mcdonalds is usually very prompt with servicing your order however it took about minute to go through the drivethru line tonight at pm it should not take minute to get fast food my friend and i ordered fry a double cheeseburger and a mcdouble definitely one of the slowest drive thrus ive experienced but perhaps it wa just an off day for them this mcdonalds is also very close to downtown highland park so you can grab a bite to eat at mcdonalds and then head to the york or hermosillo down the road for some drinksits located in a quiet neighborhood with not a whole lot of traffic cant complain about that', 'the service wa pretty bad we ordered our food normally and we wondered why we were waiting so long so when we checked on it they took our receipt and the time wa apparently dated wrong and they accused of u lying when we werent they said theyd get u our food and when we went back again they asked u again if we wanted the money or food so we ended up just leaving i wont be coming back to this mcdonalds again', 'i wrote most of this on the

display of fast food prowess isnt enough to grant me elite status i just dont know what isbecause it mcdonalds and everyone know that mcdonalds serf the most amazing flashfrozen food in the world i employ a different rating system where every one i go to start at star i take off star according to my experience therelets begin for this location star it mcdonalds for chrissake i dont need to justify this star i had to knock it down one star because they ran out of cheeseburger once at like am when they first told me it didnt even register in my brain i ordered two cheeseburger and the lady replied sorry we dont have cheeseburger right now all i could say wa no just a regular one not a mcdouble she had to repeat it again and i wa so flabbergasted that i sat silently in the drivethru window a my world wa crashing around me four hour later i wa able to collect my thought and order a filetofish star there is a constant ring of transient that surround this place late at night they come up to you when youre pulling up to the window they dont even ask for food they try and give you money to buy stuff for them because presumably you cant ride a shopping cart into the drivethru one time i wa feeling nice and bought a lady a coffee but then she proceeded to yell at me a i wa driving away because i only got her sugar packet instead of the million that she requested on the plus side the establishment doe a reasonably good job of keeping them out after hour so now i know where to board myself up during a zombie apocalypse star one time they questioned me when i ordered nugget

came out i guess i never learn', 'not to madly contradict what others are saying but in fairness the location is in an industrial part of downtown la in the produce market area at night the area is pretty desolate until the early morning hour of around or in the morning when the area come alive now i will admit that the proximity to the greyhound station isnt attracting the typical mcdonalds crowd and i expect they sell more dollar menu item than they do happy meal and it wouldnt be my first choice ordinarily but the other mcdonalds at olympic and central wa closed due to remodeling on a night i wa really craving some fry on the way home so i put on my bold face the one that say dont ask me st and figured id tough it out at alameda and th it wa around pm on a weeknightwhen i pulled in i noticed how brightly lit it wa and while there seemed to be a few car in the drive thru none of them looked like they were waiting for very long seeing the same type of buzz inside i decided to go inside and walk up to the counterwhen i got inside i can only guess someone there read yelp review it wa ridiculously clean they seemed to have adequate staff on hand and they moved very efficiently the counter staff wa very friendly the food came fast and wa hotnow naturally this shouldnt be a guarantee for all future visit but it wa a good experience and show what can be done a such my star

semipermanent place i visitwhat i found on my first visit and subsequent visit wa a newfound appreciation for mcdonalds i mean like i felt like a kid againyou know back when i liked it this mcdonalds

glad they make you pay for italways a winner in my book i dont know what it is but the food actually taste goodlike food you dont feel like youre eating crap or trash it amazing it good mcdonalds the way it wa when you were a five yearold i cant believe it i cant explain it i will dream of eating here againthey have a security guard which impressed me and since they are a hour i wont lie to youive considered itand it quite the drive hahanow the review for this location seem terrible hobocentral ive seen none so it my guess the management ha really upped it because it is also one of the cleanest

friesthe salty fry i dont like mcdonalds but i love this one', 'bum city slow drive thru slow employee and dirty restroom the mcdonalds food is the same a always', 'foodits a mcdonalds they are all the same food wise right i mean they have to be mac snack wrap those clever bastard not even good but fun to say out loud when ordering locationthis one probably used to be all bright eyed and bushy

neatly folded franchise license then it got lost lost into the heart of a dismaying darkness along a transient corridor known a alameda it employee of the month dream fading against the howling wind of reality in la but with it golden arch still standing a a beacon for those hungrystaffi didnt think mcdonalds could possibly produce employee this professionally hardened no the staff here have to be contractor hired gun soldier of fortune blackwater mercenary warrior jaded after year of serving tour in suburbia and south central they are a high speed low drag group geared up everyday to get our food hot and fast while defending their outpost from the raiding band of scavenger send this icy eyed crew into afghanistan and watch the new york time and amnesty international front cover fill with picture of cry child and burning village this is the closest mcds to my place downtown so eff it yes the local can be annoying a the other reviewer have stated i am cautious to say that they are harmless because i cannot guarantee that eating inside wa probably one the most colorful experience and worst mistake i ever made in my life and ill leave it at that the drive thru is not so bad at the window the employee will yell at the local to leave you alone which often time they will just never get out of the boat when you crave those delicious corn product filled meat patty', 'i agree with all the review here worst mcdonalds ever it not just hobo central but a i walked up to the cashier to take my order i saw a handful of roach crawling on the front of the counter ick ick ick im

put cream in your coffee for you but they kept putting some weird syrup in my coffee it wa really weird tasting on different occasion then another time i placed a big order and they left out three item this last time they were only taking cash because they claimed their cc processor wa down but they didnt tell me when i placed my order in the drivethru only once i got to the payment window and with no apology for any inconvenience it wa just cash only shrug bastard i dont recommend this place at all', 'mcdonalds u suck this is by far the worst when it come to customer service i wont ever come back here', 'while the place look nice and the restroom are clean the staff sound very fake the staff is friendly attentive and fast but when they talk to you while ordering or asking them for

your bill here dont make me feel like im bothering you fyi the person im really talking about is the gay asian guy i couldnt read his name tag but he seemed to care more about himself and his coworkers than helping me out', 'this place is so crowded and disorganized people that havent ordered yet are standing beside people that have already ordered waiting for pick up you dont want to cut in front of anybody so figuring out where the line end is another hassle i tried to just wait but nobody wa taking order nor leaving with their foodrather than just continue to stand there like a idiot zombie i turned around and walked back out and went to the carls jr across the street mcdonalds used to make me so happy a a child now a an adult i hate the experiencei wa here at this same

the fry bad', 'i dont need to review the food a everyone know what it like either way depending on their opinionthis location is one of the biggest ive ever been in and ha free wifi however what make this place special is the vast assortment of fairly crazy people that hole up here im hardly unsympathetic to the homeless but if youve been here you know what im talking about try itits quite an adventure def some regular that set up camp who are just plain off which can make it uncomfortable sometimes i actually feel a bit sorry for the staff for all the daily crap they must have to endure belligerent customer who are mentally ill and have plenty of free time it must be fairly soulcrushing but most of the worker manage to still be polite', 'while waiting for the consulate of el salvador to open we came in here to get breakfast it wa nicely designed and very clean the girl that wa helping the line wa friendly and very efficient considering she wa the only one taking and fulfilling all

twice but on three different occassions they couldnt get that right the first time i got a small coffee instead of the large the second time i got a large iced coffee with creme and sugar the third time i got a black iced coffee yeah not quite sure what else to say the third time i wa in there the manager and what appeared to be either the owner or someone in a higher level wa there when i got my coffee it wa spilling over and the guy behind the register didnt even offer to wipe it off or hand me napkin he just gave it to me and proceeded to chit chat with his coworkers i turned around and looked at the manager and said this is how you serve your customer he apologized and handed me napkin wow yeah if you expect customer service or your correct ordernot matter how small it is dont go here', 'everytime i go in this mcdonalds there is a line plus they always have only person ringing no matter if the line is out the door and because it is an asian neighborhoodthey clearly allow asian people to be rude a however they want cutting in line and all i would rather starve than eat here', 'i am writing a review for mcdonalds due to my experience there tonight i usually try my best to avoid this location because of the loiterer they are not like the usual homeless people at other place and i get skeeved by them i cant really describemaybe escapee from the loony house or zombie anywayof course while waiting in line at the drivethru i see yet another of these loiterer i started cringing and wished i never came here but when we pulled up to the pickup window i noticed that there wa a security guard he stand right by the door and when this loiterer wa sneaking back up to the mcd premise he basically busted out his handcuff the loiterer ran offits a sad situation but a relief at a same time to witness tonight mcd action', 'bigger the industry lower the quality of a product particularly food industry mcdonalds is a champ on this matter i go to this place for a drink from time to time my boyfriend is hooked on their juice it is nice but thats about it they are spending too much on their franchise marketing and packaging food should look more natural than trying to make it look like on a pictureplastic silicone and who know what ice cream are also ok but i wouldnt go further than thatalso i feel sorry for employee', 'the only thing im going to write about it is the location itself and the service this location is great if you work nearby so you dont have to park behind the building and there is a lot of seating however it is always crowded and some of the people who are there seem a little suspect the worker quite efficient i imagine that with the sort of crowd they get they are pretty fast at getting your food out pretty quickly just order and theyll take your name down and then youll get your food within minute due to the myriad type of character that are inside i tend to just pick up my food and head back to eat in my office', 'i go here frequently during lunch but why is it that they never have any apple pie ready they always ask that you wait minute for them', 'the only thing that saved this fast food restaurant from receiving two star from me is their table availability and sizeenvironment this mcdonalds ha a big table for a group of people if i remember it correctly the big letdown is the store policy of no refill on drink allowed and loitering is not allowed only maximum of minutesfood the quality in term of newly cooked is dependent on the time of visit i visit in the morning so their regular allday menu is not sitting in the heating trayscabinetscrewservers same a other mcdonalds', 'horrible service and they got my order wrong', 'i love junk food i know is not good for you but it the best they have the best

finished moving all of my stuff from a uhaul down the street and wa so tired and hot and all i wanted wa a mcflurry and a burger i think that wa too much to handle the mcflurry came out quickly the burger not so muchtheir weird coffee machine wa busted i dont understand why people want to eat those sugar drink and it wa making this huge line they also had about people behind the counter and of them trying to fix the machine i lie but you get the idea so i waited and waited and waited and waited for the burger like minute i hate to say stuff and i could tell they were backed up so i kept thinking it wa just getting there other people were waiting a while too i finally did say something and oh waddya know my burger wa just sitting there at the end of the linethese two middle school boy

when i got it it had sauce no big deal i walked back up explained what happened and asked if i could have another without sauce i didnt ask to replace mine a i decided to give that one to a friend and i just ordered a new one a couple minute later i got it without sauce but they also left out the bacon so i had to go back to the counter they gave me some bacon to put in but how hard is it to make these thing my second experience that id rather forget wa when i ordered a grilled chicken chipotle snack wrap snack wrap are small a it is but this one seemed to be folded in half of what is the normal size i went and asked why it wa so small and the guy got a manager who told me the chicken is weighed and it wa fine i have never had a snack wrap like that before or since i wouldnt care if they had replaced it or gave me more chicken but the fact that they stood behind it is why ill never go back there unless i absolutely have to i pretty much ate it with one bite', 'every time i came here i always have an item missing it bullif im not missing something i always get the wrong food please get ur right', 'it a mcdonalds it harlem it harlem did i mention it harlemi personally do not like harlem and this is because harlem is too overcrowded and there are some people there with very nasty attitude that you cant even look at them without someone feeling some type of way i avoid harlem at any cost that i can but i had to go to mcdonalds being said that this wa the closest first off the female there wa out of it i dont think she knew where she wa and they got all my order wrong they put some really really nasty sauce spicy buffalo on my mcchicken who put that crap on a mcchicken who in theyre right mind would do some crazy thing like that that wa the most horrible mcchicken ive ever tasted in my entire life people beware', 'awful service super slow just wanted a mcflurry and it took over ten minute with only two people ahead of me in line doesnt seem clean',

you want a closeghetto experience welcome to mcsuck', 'this place make half size mcwraps for full price see picture you can complain to manager and get it fixed but i dont think there should be need to involve a manager every time i buy a mcwrap i should get what i pay for', 'i wish i could give this negative star i understand going around closing time really isnt a great idea but this wa the worst drivethru service ive ever experienced and the owner of this restaurant should seriously consider training their staff to be courteous to the last customer do not eat here', 'this is the worst mcdonalds in the area the food is always stale do yourself a favor and go to the one in garwood they serve fresh food at that location', 'this is the worst mcdonalds ive ever had ive gone twice since

service but seating is descent during the daytime at night time seating is a disaster a the only open the ground floor there almost nowhere to sit a those seat are occupied by homeless people or people who are not eating or drinking anything usually more sanitary than most other mcdonalds but dont usually eat there that often though i would order coffee', 'so mcdonalds is currently promoting a for big mac meal plus a piece nugget sound like a great deal so i stepped in to purchase said meal for my family of young and oldthis place is always crowded of all people other than customer who use this place a a porta potty not a problem since i would never sit down and eat here anyway however the customer service is pretty darn poor and my star is based solely on that i have no expectation for mcdonalds foodsthey do not have enough staff there wa exactly one person working in the kitchen making burger one person working sodafriesice cream who i assumed to be the manager and one person working the cashier now i understand that theyre working minimum wage but that doe not excuse them to work so poorly i had to repeat my order four time and it took minute to be completed why because the cashier wa very distracted from conversing with friend and coworkers i would give zero star but star is for the manager who seemed to be the only one who wa trying to fulfill the customer ordersi

close to where i work and whenever i needed a quick meal on the go and eat it on the way back to the office i go here for month this place wa understaff and run pretty poorly long wait on nonpeak hour were common rather frustrating waiting minute for a chicken warp i could swear that some day there only one person working the cashier and another in the kitchen thats it now i think they got a new manager or kid are having their summer vacation so they are better staffed and run more efficiently typical mcdonalds stuff with ample seating and a surprising nonvomit inducing bathroom star', 'this is probably the worst mcdonalds of any mcdonalds of all time it pretty much the greyhound bus terminal of mcdonalds you go in and there are a bunch of old people just sitting around sleeping at the table a bunch of men were lined up to use the bathroom mind you none of these people had any mcdonalds food or were waiting to buy any the food tasted old and disgusting obviously because no one go to

problem with the food it the same a any other mcdonald they let you use the bathroom here and it wa decent last time i used it it wa not the dirtiest bathroom i been to not the cleanest not the

health', 'went there for a quick coffee run and a i wa waiting to order i saw a roach on the counteralso one person working the register during rush hour at a very busy location that show you how cheap of a business they are they are a terrible corporation', 'i echo a lot of these review the beauty of franchise is consistency this store somehow missed the memo on that i wont even talk about the poor service ill just focus on my sad looking big mac that looked like it wa assembled by gorillaslettuce onion and sauce dumped on a soggy broken bun every once in a blue moon i crave a big mac and on special occasion i will entertain my craving after i took my first bite i calmly laid down the soggy mess and smiled because i knew i wouldnt be craving a big mac anytime soon', 'i stopped by here in a hurry to get a quick bite and wanted something healthy knowing fast food is anything but that and having not eaten it in year i wa hesitant so surprised at how friendly the cashier wa to

booth right next to it and wouldnt give up their seat for him that look real badthe girl behind the counter wa friendly but my food took a little while longer than youd expect and when i asked for ketchup she said it in my bag but when i got to my seat it clearly wasnt then when i went back to ask again for ketchup she only gave me packet not a big deal to me because thats how much i wa going

also an ever changing rotation of new sandwich wrap salad and other specialty item all of which have the same mcdonalds qualitythis past visit i ordered a mcdouble a large french fire and a piece mcnuggets the food wa ready for me in under five minute a time almost unheard of at other restaurant i took a seat at the upstairs section and started with the mcdouble the mcdouble included two cooked beef patty cheese pickle ketchup and chopped onion very satisfying for under dollar i then switched between the hot crispy french fry and the mcnuggets small deep fried piece of chicken which i dipped in ketchup and their very tasty honey mustard sauce all in all i wa very full and content with my meal all of which cost me under at any other local restaurant just a burger and fry would have

had the mcrib sandwich thereive been waiting for my opportunitytoday that need wa satisfiedits worth a shot no surprise no real fat im sure they pulverize that a million time over and blend it in no

reviewing a fast food chain since they are all consistently the samei visit this particular mcdonalds branch often not for their food but for their cent fee atm and sometime to use their restroom

order something pay for it you dont have it and i get something cheaper instead then you owe me some money back instead i got a whole bunch of attitude like i wa really interrupting something much more important the cashier had to do and then had to debate whether i wa owed any money back at all it sure make it hard to believe that per hour is justified', 'dollar atm is always convenient other then that this mcdonalds is always crowded and ha about bum drifting away inside not really anything good to say besides that', 'im not sure how else to put this there are a few homeless people who ask for money at the entrance and inside the seating area that is reason enough to avoid this placeit can be pretty disorganized but chance are if youre here youre fully aware of what youre getting yourself intoweird bit they dont have ketchup dispenser in the seating areabut wont give you any ketchup packet without being asked thats kind of like giving me a burger and fry to go but without a

avoiding eye contact with me the whole time i got on line behind him she chitchatted with him and then went and got his food herself instead of letting the staff in the back do it another minute by the time i got to the front of the line no welcome not even a smile for me i ordered my breakfast she took my money and then proceeded to take the next two ordersthis time of course having the staff which themselves were working at a snail pace get my food she handed me the bag with no receipt and no thank you i thought to complain to the manager and then i looked at the nameplate of the person serving me she wa the manager i hardly ever have had a bad experience at mcdonalds but i guess there a first for everything from now on im getting my big mac fix at penn station or any of the other

whole damn bottle in therelooks more like a splash of coffee see pic', 'come here if youre looking for an uncomfortable experience the cashier a well a the customer make this an unpleasant experience

continuously tried talking to me there wa also another customer who told the cashier to call his friend because he needed some xanax', 'im surprised by the amount of negative review for this location

with cheeseburger on your mind i do like the computer display system that allows you to see when your order is ready and something about the layout seemed newer than other mcdonalds but maybe i wa just excited because i wa having a killer craving', 'other than the fact that it super conveniently located right outside of th street station on park avenue and that it ha more electric outlet than your average coffeeshop offering are the same crappy low class food youll find at any mcdonalds across the nation i like their coffee and sweet tea thoughone thing thats annoying is the latino looking manager hunting people down for chilling or loitering around the table but for those of u who bought something leave u the fuck alone and chill out and stop giving that certain look like were some jobless thug or something some of u want to unwind after a hour work shift with some coffee while charging our phone for god sakei saw a shady black yes i emphasize race because that is keeping it mad

to the employee just standing around instead of preparing food and filling drink order this place is a mess then add the dozen of homeless people in here and you really just want a shower when you get out i say this yet still go back at least twice a month it downstairs from my office and right off the train ok another redeeming quality is the hash brown which is perfectly cooked crispy on the outside and soft on the inside word of advice listen very closely to the number when they call them out and steer clear of the bathroom dont even stand near them', 'they seem to be pretty quick most

the intention of grabbing a quick postbeer snack with a buddy we sat down with something like chicken nugget gross i know and started eating away some few minute later we hear a commotion towards the entrance i turn around and see what appears to be the dirtiest looking homeless man with long grey hair and beard and dirt stained jacket with hole in his shoe the manager happened to notice him immediately and tried to escort him out one thing led to another and this guy started going off on one of the most hatefueled rant ive ever heard surprisingly he wa quite eloquent and made reference to movie pop culture and some literary classic objectively speaking i imagined this ish looking man wa at one point quite educated and maybe even handsome i wa too busy observing the scene to actually record anything for youtube at first he directed his hatred towards the manager and then went into a long address to everyone in the store long story short there is a revolution coming and we are illprepared we are leading our life in ignorance and before we know it the tide will shift men like him are congregating and amassing technology and weapon beyond our knowledge lol ok at this point he gestured pulling out a weapon and shooting everyone at this point the manager forcibly escorted him out against his restraint a few moment later he ran back in and pulled out an imaginary grenade tossed it in the store and ran back outside i wa just trying to enjoy my chicken nugget what the hellother than that this location is actually quite nice compare to most of the others', 'i admit im guilty and came here a few time when i had a fix for a mcrib sandwich or a piece chicken mc nugget service is just ok depends on what time of day and how crowded the place is it not a efficient a

massive renovation and is quite outstanding now i go about twice a week guilty pleasuremaking me according to super size me a heavy user', 'one of the worse mcdonaldsonly reason i go is cause it a

been once at around am but usually i go during the work day hourssometimes you get some shady character there but most of the time it just a bunch of hard working people taking a break from their day to get some of those fry or big mac', 'there really no reason for the employee to be so rude', 'swift but not really exciting average second to fill an order overfilled my drink sticky all over the place and the pickle on the cheeseburger here were really small', 'i dont know what it is about this particular corner and this particular mcdonalds but both are run amok with seedy charactersive seen prostitute in there eating with their pimp across from them by the window is this guy who is always there on his laptop free wifi maybe he look like he hasnt showered in a good decade one crackhead

work day what to do head over to mickeyds of course it wa the postlunch lull so no line cool cool got my mcflurry with oreo bit and i take a seat at one of the small booth got my latest issue of tony to read and im good to goand then unexpected company show up in the form of a year old boy he just plop down across from me and start making conversation okay so im a sucker for little kid my mom a pediatrician and i babysat for the greater part of my teen year i figure he just one of those curious gregarious kid so i humor him he asks me what i ate my mcflurry wa gone in a matter of minute what can i say and i tell him he asks me the ageold kid question why i tell him do you even really need a reason to want ice cream at this point im kinda looking around to see if there are any adult frantically searching for their kid nope the guy at the table behind the kid overhears our conversation and we make eyecontact he kinda smile at me and chucklesnext the kid asks me what im reading i tell him again why i tell him then he grab the magazine and start flipping through it okaaaynow im kinda getting antsy next he start to eat the mailer insert from the magazine whats with this kid i

of the lesson listen to your mama and dont talk to stranger oh and dont eat at mcdonalds', 'ive eaten at nougatine and abc kitchen numerous time but i have to admit that i keep coming back to this fine institution for a great meal that put jgvs work to shame the french fry are an example of potato that have been prepared in a form that may be legitimately considered a work of art the gentle texture and crisp of the fry are testament to the corporation impeccable execution of deep frying and the training that the personnel have undergone to achieve this perfection across the franchise is very much laudable my experience with the beef ha been nothing short of flawless a i had requested the patty in my burger wa prepared to a mediumrare and the subtle cheese and softlygrated onion danced with the rich ketchup and mustard on my tongue a i tasted thick and quality processed meat between two piece of toasted and warm bun the acidity of the salted fry and that of the burger did not balance quite a i liked it though i wa very much satisfied anyway i have to say that short of makeup sex i have had no better experience in my s to finish my threecourse the apple pie were magnificent the texture of the apple led me to believe that they were in fact potato but i must commend mcdonalds for aptly managing their resource and overhead by taking advantage of economy of scale in purchasing only mass quantity of one ingredient a opposed to diversifying their portfolio this may lead to higher margin in that the franchise would be able to provide more product in their menu eg genuine apple smoothy or appleinfused panacotta but would ultimately lead to higher operating cost in any case the dessert wa very much satisfyingthough i paid only for this meal i must have gained the delight of a meal cheer to an amazing institution for providing a meal aptly suited for all social caste', 'food is rarely fresh never got good tasting fry in this mcdonalds what i thought i liked

placed your order before them which would imply your order would come up first you can easily sit in that left lane for minute while the people behind you are helpless and honk uselessly trying to

it is such a hub for student the inside is usually kept clean but is on the small side the drive through can be a pain to deal with because of the long wait and relatively slow costumer service main

i received my food i sat myself a far from the register a possible to avoid the shouting unsuccessfully not only could she be heard from my seat at the back of the restaurant but at one point she walked throughout the location with her engineer shouting at him the entire time about the event of her recent manager meeting and how he would be the one to get in trouble if anyone called her

nice a well and easy to read i dont really eat at mcdonalds so i cant say much about the food what i do usually order and enjoy wa their vanilla cone delicious nonfat vanilla soft serve in a light and crispy cone the best part of this location is the fact that it is one of the very few corporate store in the valley and offer the vanilla cone at just after sale tax what an awesome deal especially when franchised location charge and upso based on the nice welcoming lobby and consistently delicious cone i have no complaint bonus free wifi and the lobby and drivethru are open hour', 'this is not a familyfriendly location there always a crowd of undesirable hanging outside and even inside the police are always circling around sometimes police car at once i also witnessed an older gentleman pick up who i believe to have been a prostitute he pulled up shortly after i did i sat in the car for a while handling business on the phone he stayed in his car after a while a young man exited with a woman dressed differently and watched her walk over to his car they drove away together i decided it wa time to go', 'i love this mcdonalds the worker are always friendly and welcome you a you walk into the door the first time i walked into this store i wa shocked the store ha chandelier and antique and art on the wall it look more like a five star restaurant that a fast food joint the bathroom even have gold plated fixturesits still mcdonalds so the food is the same a everywhere else but the employee and atmosphere make it a pleasant experience', 'really rude worker and customer service wa just overall horrible the biscuit were hard a rock and their sausage seem to have been cooked hour before i bought it avoid this place if possible', 'worst mcdonalds everevery single time we have been

wrong i wish i could give negative star because this mc donalds wa horrible there wa so much trash lying around my family and i almost left', 'normally i dont review a chain unless something about that particular location stand out good or badthis location for some reason ha the most ridiculous service ive ever encountered it mcdonalds you say what do you expect not much really but let me tell youencounter i ordered piece chicken nugget fry and unsweetened ice tea i got the nugget and tea i went up to the counter placed my receipt on the counter gently faced away from me and said im sorry i before i finished my sentence the employee slammed her hand on my receipt on the counter and dragged it towards her um wtfi didnt know how to react because she looked at my receipt and threw it away without addressing me i went umok and backed away from the counter to fill my tea i have no clue what i did to piss this employee off but my friend who came with me asked me what the heck happened i said i have no clue im just missing my fry my friend wa nice and itchy enough to go up to the counter grab the attention of a different employee and told him we were missing our friesbut honestly what is wrong with you im sorry you were having a bad day but that doesnt excuse you from taking it out on a customer who wa trying to be nice about an honest mistake that can be easily fixed not a big deal i paid for fry and i have an incomplete order so chill geezencounter friend and i came here for smoothy one of my friend ordered a big mac nugget and fry everyone else got our order my friend waited minute for his order to be done no lie we looked at the time on the receiptyoure thinking um yea maybe they were cooking it noin that minute we saw employee goofing off bickering with each other throwing towel at each other and basically being extremely unprofessional they didnt even do this in the back were customer cant see they did this all in front of u just on the other side of the counter based on the manager asking where the order is they seem to have forgotten about the orderi dont care if you do this at work but can you do this when no one is waiting for their food it really awkward to be standing and waiting while watching you goof off and have your manager ask the team where our order is three timesi really felt embarrassed for the manager because this just reflects badly on him but he really should be more assertive and keep his team in check for his credit he did give u a coupon for a free dessert of our choicewhich honestly is nothing because i dont ever order a pie cone or sundaeoh and our smoothy were not filled all the way to the top mine wa full', 'every time i come here they mess up my orderi never leave the drive thru window before checking any more', 'dont go here if youre looking for fast food theyre fast to take your order but thats where it end', 'ok ok ok i know it only a mcdonalds but this one is completely different in decor it big clean bright and pretty with ton of flat screen all over the place another big plus to this mcdonalds is that theyve got free wifi while most hotel charge ridiculous fee so if and when you have your laptop you can deal with business while munching on some frieseven though it smack dab on the strip there plenty of parking too', 'okay so i came in here yesterday around pm i took a while trying to make up my mind i had seen a commercial about the mozzarella stick so i thought i would try that a mcdouble and a medium french fry when i ordered i started with the mozzarella stick the cashier thought i said chicken mcnuggets i corrected her and said the mozzarella stick then i also ordered the mcdouble and the medium french fry my order wa rung up and i got my order withing minute thats good bad i cant for the life of me find where the salt pepper and ketchup is on the first floor if they have it on the second floor i dont remember i wa in a rush to get home so i grabbed my food and went to wait for the subway i looked in the bag and wa surprised at what i saw in my bag wa a medium order of french fry chicken mcnuggets a mcdouble and a pack of marinara sauce i used the marinara sauce for the chicken however in what language doe mozzarella stick sound like chicken mcnuggets and i wonder what the price difference wa between the mozzarella stick and piece chicken mcnuggetsi already swiped my metrocard so it wasnt worth it to complain', 'the drive thru got our order wrong again i called the manager who argued with me about what wa ordered i had to ask her if she cared or wa even going to help me she just continued to argue that the drive thru entered what wa ordered yelling at me and interrupting me a i told her repeatedly they took the order wrong and this is not the first time this ha happened after asking if she wa going to be of help she refused saying to call back tomorrow to talk to someone else and hung up on me just because an employee here doesnt have to be an intelligent person doesnt mean they can be rude im sure she is smarter than a dog and even dog know how to be polite', 'breakfast for the family and kid of u messed up the whole order missing hot cake missing egg missing yogurt parfait four napkin four ketchup starbut what do you expect from a macdonalds in vega', 'if i could put zero star it would deserve that rude rude rude manager the worst mcdonalds i have ever been to they forced me to buy a large meal when i only wanted chicken nugget how is that legal you cant refuse to serve what i order because you just want to make more money

time dirt everywhere food barely warmand slow service need a manager', 'when i am really craving for mcdonalds this seems to be the closest but im no big fan of fast food chainsi dont like this location just because there are bum inside waiting for the bus to go to atlantic city or whateverthey usually sit and chat and drink some coffee same food a any other mcdonalds waitress are friendly', 'two point right out of the gate thuggery know no race lily white frat boy from the suburb can be just a vulgar and aggressive a any group with a gang mentality rating a mcdonalds and mcdonalds food isnt really an essential service people generally know what theyre getting menu and quality wise going in the purpose of this review is mostly about the safety factor people need to know and i think local already do that depending on the time of day night this place is marginally dangerous over my last three visit to chicago ive noticed this neighborhood being overrun by flash mob who do more looting aggressive panhandling and fighting than choreographed performing in fact this particular mcdonalds had to be closed down for several hour a couple month ago while police attempted to restore order the water tower place mall about a block away ha seen an increase in gang activity lately including the arrest of some armed teenager this isnt just my take check out some of the other review of this place and this neighborhood many are pointing out that the mag mile is slowly becoming the mug mile and this mcdonalds seems to be ground zero for hip hop nation a they pour off the red line after taking up two seat on the subway while grandma ha to stand apologist and the agenda driven will say and have said these kid are guilty of nothing other than being black in a predominantly white neighborhood really since when doe being authentically black include screaming nonstop obscenity with little kid around black and white since when did chicago get so soft on youth crime since when did it become open season on civility since when did my review start reading like the ranting of some terrified reactionaryfascist while it mildly funny that katelyn emily ashley and their dolly buying mommy must sometimes contend with this thuggery after they leave the american girl doll store nobody not even the overprivileged country club set should have to endure this genuinely menacing behavior and youth thug of any race should not be permitted to turn this area into the wild midwest just a thought rahm do what you want with it', 'i wanted to grab breakfast one morning before work since it just across the street but the restaurant wa filled with homeless people it like their hangout spot i waited a lot longer than i needed to just to order if they didnt have bum loitering around maybe would have added one more star the staff is not the problem they look like they actually have to deal with a lot if problematic people they should focus on making the place a little pleasant for their guest no one want to eat their burger while having to endure the smell if urine lingering off a homeless person']\n"
